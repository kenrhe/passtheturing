1
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,931
She's not here yet! She's having
my baby and she's not here!

2
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,892
It's fine.
Has her water broken yet?

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:13,896
I don't know.

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,052
She told me she'd already
passed the mucus plug.

5
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,371
Do we have to know about that?

6
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,612
What'll you do when
you have a baby?

7
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:28,296
I'm gonna be in the waiting room,
handing out cigars.

8
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,529
Joey's made arrangements to have
his baby in a movie from the '50s.

9
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,532
I don't believe this!
She could be giving birth in the cab!

10
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,937
Relax. It's only $2
for the first contraction. . .

11
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,252
. . .and then 50 cents for each
additional contraction.

12
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,689
What, it's okay
when Chandler does it?

13
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,578
You have to pick your moments.

14
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,414
-Did I miss it?
-She's not even here yet.

15
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:55,888
What's with the guitar?

16
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:00,053
I thought we might be here for a while.
Things might get musical.

17
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,052
-Where have you been?
-We stopped at the gift shop.

18
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,410
I wanted a stuffed animal.
Susan wanted a Chunky.

19
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,696
Susan wanted a--
You're having a baby!

20
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,658
You don't stop for Chunkies!

21
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,930
I used to have that bumper sticker.

22
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,329
You see what I mean?

23
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,578
The One With the Birth

00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,695
Let it go, Ross.

27
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,896
I got an extra one.
You want this?

28
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:14,289
-How's my favorite parenting team?
-Dr. Franzblau. Hi.

29
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,293
I understand you're thinking
of having a baby.

30
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,334
I see you're nine months pregnant.
That's a good start.

31
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,408
How are your contractions?

32
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:27,374
I love them! Each one's
like a little party in my uterus!

33
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,337
They're every four minutes
and last 55 seconds.

34
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,616
59 seconds.
Quartz.

35
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,734
Swiss quartz.

36
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,498
Am I allowed to drink anything?

37
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,935
Ice chips.
They're at the nurse's station.

38
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,410
-I'II get them!
-No, I'm getting it!

39
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,694
Thought you might Like
some ice chips.

40
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,495
-Thanks.
-And if you need anything else, I. . .

41
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,417
. . .do not believe we have met.

42
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,219
I'm Rachel Greene.

43
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,611
I'm Carol’s ex-husband's
sister's roommate.

44
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,409
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Dr. Franzblau.

45
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,891
I'm your roommate's brother's
ex-wife's obstetrician.

46
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,293
Oh, that's funny!

47
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,498
I want a baby!

48
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,013
Not tonight, honey.
I got an early day tomorrow.

49
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,057
Get up. Come on,
let's get some coffee.

50
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,091
Okay, because we never do that.

51
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,494
Shoot, shoot, shoot!

52
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,336
Or just fall down.
That's good too.

53
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,295
Knick fan?

54
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,457
Oh, boy, do they suck!

55
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,610
Listen, lady--

56
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,056
Look!

57
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,495
Look at your man, Ewing.

58
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,931
Nice shot. He couldn’t hit water
if he was standing on a boat.

59
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,579
And who do you Like?

60
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,737
-Celtics.
-Celtics?

61
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,898
They couldn’t hit a boat if--

62
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:53,936
Wait. . . .

63
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,293
They suck, all right?

64
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,410
Shut up!
It's a rebuilding year--

65
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,729
Let me get the father!
We need a father over here!

66
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,732
There's no father.

67
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,290
Oh, sorry.

68
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,376
That's okay. I'm fine.

69
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,698
Okay. AII right.
Right this way.

70
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,892
AII the other pregnant women
seem to be going in here.

71
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:29,890
They're tiny and chubby
And so sweet to touch

72
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:33,655
But soon they'll grow up
And resent you so much

73
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,339
Now they're yelling at you
And you don't know why

74
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,334
And you cry and you cry
And you cry

75
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,538
And you cry and you cry
And you cry

76
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,816
-Thanks, Ross.
-I'm paying you to stop.

77
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,934
Oh, look, twins.
Hi, guys. Oh, cute.

78
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:57,936
No fair!

79
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,854
I don't even have one!
How come they get two?

80
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,215
You'll get one.

81
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:03,776
When?

82
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,695
Tell you what. When we're 40,
and if neither of us are married. . .

83
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,535
. . .what do you say
we have one together?

84
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,537
Why won't I be married
when I'm 40?

85
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,693
I just meant hypothetically.

86
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,773
''Hypothetically,'' why won't I be
married when I'm 40?

87
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,690
What is it? Is there something
unmarriable about me?

88
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,899
Well?

89
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:30,098
Dear God!
This parachute is a knapsack!

90
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,530
Look at you, dressy-dress.

91
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,493
Did you go home and change?

92
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,295
It's an important day.
I want to Look nice.

93
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,651
Has Dr. Franzblau been by. . .?

94
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,209
I haven't seen him.

95
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,094
Where is he?
He is supposed to be here.

96
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,211
What if the baby needs him?

97
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,496
What's the deal with you
and doctors?

98
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,099
Is your father a doctor?

99
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,133
Yeah. Why?

100
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,489
No reason.

101
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,530
Mom, we've been through this.

102
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,214
No, I am not calling him.

103
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,293
I don't care if it is his kid,
the guy's a jerk!

104
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:16,089
No, I am not alone.
Joey's here.

105
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,732
What do you mean, ''Joey who''?

106
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,095
Joey who?

107
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,298
-Tribbiani.
-Joey Tribbiani.

108
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,129
Hold on.

109
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,733
She wants to talk to you.

110
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,333
Take the phone!

111
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,899
Yeah, it's me.

112
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,451
We're just friends.

113
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,893
Yeah, I'm single.

114
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,928
Twenty-five.

115
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,695
An actor.

116
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,414
She's not much of a phone person.

117
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,175
So what's the deal
with this father guy?

118
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:01,089
If someone was having my baby,
I'd wanna know about it.

119
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:05,379
Hey, Knick fan, am I interested
in your views on fatherhood?

120
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,179
Look, maybe I should just go.

121
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,256
Maybe you should.

122
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,493
Good luck. . .

123
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,695
. . .and take care.

124
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,578
Know what the Celtics' problem is?
Players run the team.

125
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,895
That is so not true!

126
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,812
-Oh, it is!
-It isn't!

127
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,772
-Breathe.
-Breathe.

128
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,098
You're gonna kill me!

129
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:37,539
-Fifteen more seconds! 1 4, 1 3, 1 2--
-Count faster!

130
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,374
It'll be okay!
Just keep focusing on Jordy!

131
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,649
Who the hell is Jordy?

132
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,336
Your son.

133
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,292
I don't have a son named Jordy.

134
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,411
We all agreed,
my son's name is Jamie.

135
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,015
Jamie was the name
of Susan's first girlfriend. . .

136
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,693
. . .so we went back to Jordy.

137
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:57,133
What do you mean, back to Jordy?
We never landed on Jordy!

138
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:01,811
We just passed by it during the whole
Jesse/ Cody/Dillon fiasco.

139
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,576
Cramped leg!

140
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,930
-I got it!
-I got it! I'm doing it!

141
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,455
You get to sleep with her!
I get the cramps!

142
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,615
No, you don't!

143
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,890
That is it!
I want both of you out!

144
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,414
-She started it!
-He did!

145
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,930
I don't care! I'm trying to get
a person out of my body here. . .

146
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,297
. . .and you're not making it
any easier! Now go!

147
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,732
-Thanks a lot.
-See what you did?

148
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,493
-Listen--
-Out!

149
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,175
Breathe! Breathe!

150
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,335
What is that?

151
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,536
Something exploded!

152
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,051
It's just her water breaking.
Calm down!

153
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,411
Water breaking?
What do you mean? What's that?

154
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,417
Breathe. Breathe.

155
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,137
Oh, please!
This is so your fault!

156
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,495
How is this my fault?

157
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,931
Carol never threw me out of a room
before you came along.

158
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,779
There's a Lot Carol never did
before I came along.

159
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,536
-Are you trying to be clever?
-You are so threatened by me!

160
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,772
Hey! Okay! AII right!

161
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,459
That's it! Get in here!

162
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,936
My God, you guys!
I don't believe you!

163
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,092
There are children
coming into the world here. . .

164
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,696
. . .and your fighting noises are not
the first thing they should hear!

165
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,295
So just stop all the yelling!
Just stop it!

166
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,536
Don't make me do this again!
I don't Like my voice Like this!

167
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,855
Who wants to hear something ironic?

168
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,172
-Help!
-Come on!

169
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,294
-I'm having a baby in there!
-Hello!

170
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,779
Everyone stand back.

171
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,416
Are they here yet?

172
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,890
Don't worry,
we're gonna find them.

173
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,297
And until we do,
we are all here for you. Okay?

174
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,091
Anyway, you were telling me
about Paris. It sounds wonderful!

175
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,650
There was this great Little
pastry shop right by my hotel--

176
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,493
There you go, dear.

177
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,016
Come on, Lydia, you can do it!
Push!

178
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,974
Push him out, push him out.
Harder, harder!

179
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,530
Push him out, push him out!
Way out!

180
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:29,499
Let's get that ball and really move!

181
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,689
Let's get--

182
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,895
I was just--

183
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,255
Push, push, push!

184
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,535
What are you gonna do,
suck the door open?

185
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,740
Help! Help!

186
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,539
And they found their bodies
The very next day

187
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:55,528
And they found their bodies
The very next--

188
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,216
Mom, everything's going fine.

189
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,893
Ross is great.

190
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,691
He's in a whole other place!

191
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,693
No, he's gone.

192
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,292
No, you don't have to fly back.
Really.

193
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,929
What do you mean,
''This might be your only chance''?

194
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,937
Would you stop?
I'm only 26.

195
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,899
I'm not even thinking
about babies yet.

196
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,372
-Where have you been?
-I just had a baby.

197
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,099
Mazel tov!

198
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,337
It could be one hour or three.

199
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,696
But relax.
She's doing great.

200
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:51,252
So tell me, are you currently
involved with anyone?

201
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,296
Not at the moment, I'm not.

202
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,495
Are you?

203
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,897
No, it's hard enough to get women
to go out with me.

204
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,899
Right. Yeah, I've heard that
about cute doctors.

205
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,298
No, really. I suppose it's because
I spend so much time, you know. . .

206
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,934
. . .where I do.

207
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,735
I try not to let work
affect my personal life.

208
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,210
But it's hard when,
when you do. . .

209
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,297
. . .what I do. It's Like. . . .

210
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,295
Well, for instance,
what do you do?

211
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,899
I'm a waitress.

212
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:29,416
Aren't there times when you come
home at the end of the day. . .

213
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,689
. . .and you're, Like:

214
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,494
''If I see one more cup of coffee'' . . . .

215
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,136
Gotcha.

216
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,293
-I'm gonna check up on your friend.
-That's fine.

217
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,053
How did you know I was here?

218
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,973
Your mom called me.

219
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,898
So is this her?

220
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,052
No, this is a loaner.

221
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,693
Listen, I'm sorry
you had to do this by yourself.

222
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:10,970
I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor,
nurse and a helper guy.

223
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,298
So did you see who won the game?

224
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,493
The Knicks by 1 0.
They suck!

225
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,493
They're not so bad.

226
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,332
Come on! Come on!

227
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,934
Damn it! Damn it!

228
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,410
Damn it, damn it!
This is all your fault!

229
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,009
This should be
the greatest day of my Life!

230
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,694
My son is being born,
and I should be in there!

231
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,095
Instead, I'm stuck
in a closet with you!

232
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,457
I've been waiting for this
just as much as you have!

233
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,697
Believe me, no one's been waiting
for this as much as I have.

234
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,128
And you know what's funny?

235
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:08,770
You get to go home with the baby.
Where does that leave me?

236
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,299
You get to be his father!

237
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,288
And who am I? There's Father's Day!
There's Mother's Day!

238
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,695
There's no Lesbian Lover Day!

239
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,295
Everyday is Lesbian Lover Day!

240
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,692
This is so great!

241
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,179
Do you wanna explain that?

242
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,937
I mean, when I was growing up,
my dad left. . .

243
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,809
. . .and my mother died
and my stepfather went to jail.

244
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,496
I barely had enough pieces
of parents to make one whole one.

245
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,091
And here's this baby who has
three whole parents. . .

246
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,054
. . .who care so much that they fight
over who gets to Love it the most. . .

247
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,296
. . .and it's not even born yet!

248
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,169
It's just the luckiest baby
in the whole world.

249
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,691
I'm sorry. You were fighting.

250
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,293
Where are they?

251
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,253
-I'm sure they'll be here soon.
-They wouldn’t miss this.

252
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:09,090
Relax! You're only at nine centimeters,
and the baby's at zero station.

253
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,297
You are really frightening me.

254
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,371
Help me!
Trying to rip out my heart!

255
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,294
That's great!
Anybody seen a nipple?

256
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,536
Ten centimeters.
Here we go.

257
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,492
AII right, time to start pushing!

258
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,855
But they're not here yet!

259
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,130
I can't tell the baby
to wait for them.

260
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,292
Oh, God!

261
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,297
Okay, got the vent open.

262
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,296
I'm Ben.

263
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,290
I'm hospital worker Ben.

264
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,618
It's Ben to the rescue!

265
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,528
Ben, you ready?

266
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,099
Give me your foot.

267
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,054
On three, Ben.
One, two, three.

268
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,492
Come on, Ben.
That's it, Ben.

269
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,893
What do you see?

270
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,818
I see what appears to be
a dark vent.

271
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,129
Wait!

272
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:12,292
Yes, it is, in fact, a dark vent!

273
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,890
Pheebs, it's open!
It's open!

274
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,456
Wait!

275
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,890
You forgot your legs!

276
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,729
Push! Push!

277
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,698
We're here! We're here!

278
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,493
Where have you been?

279
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,489
Long story, honey.

280
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,611
I need you to keep pushing.
I need--

281
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,572
Excuse me, can I have this?

282
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,738
There's too many people here!
There's about to be one more!

283
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,370
So anybody who's not an ex-husband
or a lesbian Life partner. . .

284
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,729
. . .out you go!

285
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,250
-Bye-bye!
-Good Luck, you guys!

286
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:54,896
Let me ask you, do you have to be
Carol’s Lesbian Life partner?

287
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,568
Out!

288
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,975
Here he comes!

289
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,893
Let me see! I've got to see,
I've got to see!

290
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,295
A head!

291
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,209
It's huge!
How are you doing this?

292
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,416
You're not helping!

293
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,338
You're doing great!
You're doing fine!

294
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,411
-Hello?
-Oh, sorry!

295
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,576
What do you see?
What do you see?

296
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,930
We got a head.
We got arms. We got--

297
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,579
Look at the Little fingers!

298
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,098
A chest and a stomach. . .

299
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,649
. . .and it's a boy, definitely a boy!

300
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,976
Legs, knees and feet.

301
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,095
He's here!

302
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,729
He's a person!

303
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,050
-Look at that!
-Who does he Look Like?

304
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,897
Kind of Like my Uncle Ed,
covered in Jell-O.

305
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,695
Really?

306
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,730
You guys, he's beautiful!

307
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,493
Thanks, Pheebs!

308
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,891
No shouting, but we still need
a name for this Little guy.

309
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,293
How about Ben?

310
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,699
I Like Ben.

311
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,488
Ben.

312
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,694
Ben's good.

313
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,817
How come you never
mentioned Ben before?

314
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,488
We just cooked it up.

315
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,491
That's what we were off doing.

316
