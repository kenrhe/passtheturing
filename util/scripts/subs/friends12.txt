1
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:56,961
No, no, we're done!

2
00:01:00,492 --> 00:01:01,686
The One With the Dozen Lasagnas

English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

4
00:01:45,052 --> 00:01:47,327
Aunt Silv, stop yelling!

5
00:01:47,572 --> 00:01:50,291
If you'd told me
vegetarian lasagna. . .

6
00:01:50,492 --> 00:01:52,881
. . .I would've made
vegetarian lasagna.

7
00:01:54,332 --> 00:01:56,084
The meat's only every third layer.

8
00:01:56,332 --> 00:01:57,890
Maybe you could scrape.

9
00:01:58,732 --> 00:02:01,610
Ross, did you really read
all these baby books?

10
00:02:01,812 --> 00:02:05,725
You could plunk me down in
any woman's uterus, no compass. . .

11
00:02:06,572 --> 00:02:08,528
. . .and I could find my way
out like that!

12
00:02:09,972 --> 00:02:11,007
This is cool.

13
00:02:11,252 --> 00:02:14,608
It says in some parts of the world
people eat the placenta.

14
00:02:17,092 --> 00:02:19,083
And we're done with the yogurt.

15
00:02:21,012 --> 00:02:21,808
Sorry.

16
00:02:22,492 --> 00:02:25,723
Aunt Silv, I did this as a favor.
I am not a caterer.

17
00:02:25,972 --> 00:02:28,566
What do you want me to do
with a dozen lasagnas?

18
00:02:29,932 --> 00:02:32,082
Nice talk, Aunt Silv.

19
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,404
You kiss Uncle Freddie
with that mouth?

20
00:02:36,092 --> 00:02:37,525
Ross, listen.

21
00:02:37,772 --> 00:02:40,605
Do you know that right now
your baby is only this big?

22
00:02:40,852 --> 00:02:42,968
This is your baby.
''Hi, Daddy. ''

23
00:02:43,652 --> 00:02:44,448
Hello.

24
00:02:45,212 --> 00:02:46,725
''How come you don't live with Mommy?''

25
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,163
''How come Mommy lives
with that other lady?''

26
00:02:56,652 --> 00:02:58,370
''What's a lesbian?''

27
00:03:03,692 --> 00:03:06,490
Honey, you can say it.
It's Poconos. Poconos.

28
00:03:06,732 --> 00:03:10,122
It's like ''poke a nose. ''

29
00:03:11,972 --> 00:03:14,884
Poke a nose.

30
00:03:22,772 --> 00:03:25,491
So did I hear ''Poconos''?

31
00:03:25,732 --> 00:03:27,962
My sister's giving us her place
for the weekend.

32
00:03:29,252 --> 00:03:30,480
First weekend away together.

33
00:03:30,692 --> 00:03:32,922
-Yeah, it's a big step.
-I know.

34
00:03:33,932 --> 00:03:35,365
It's just a weekend.
Big deal.

35
00:03:35,572 --> 00:03:38,132
Wasn't this supposed to be
just a fling?

36
00:03:38,372 --> 00:03:39,885
Shouldn't it be. . .

37
00:03:40,452 --> 00:03:41,885
. . .flung by now?

38
00:03:42,772 --> 00:03:44,524
We are way past the ''fling'' thing.

39
00:03:44,772 --> 00:03:48,481
I'm feeling things I've only
read about in Danielle Steel books.

40
00:03:48,732 --> 00:03:51,690
When I'm with him,
I'm just totally, totally. . . .

41
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:54,492
Nauseous.
I'm physically nauseous.

42
00:03:55,532 --> 00:03:58,888
What am I supposed to do?
Call Immigration?

43
00:03:59,732 --> 00:04:01,450
I could call Immigration.

44
00:04:07,692 --> 00:04:11,128
I love babies with
their little baby shoes. . .

45
00:04:11,332 --> 00:04:15,166
. . .and their little baby toes
and their little hands. . . .

46
00:04:15,412 --> 00:04:17,482
You're gonna have to stop that. . .

47
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:18,568
. . .forever.

48
00:04:28,452 --> 00:04:29,885
Need a new table.

49
00:04:30,572 --> 00:04:31,687
You think?

50
00:04:38,772 --> 00:04:41,047
-Come on in.
-Hello.

51
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:42,407
I brought the books. . .

52
00:04:42,932 --> 00:04:45,287
. . .and Monica sends her love
along with this lasagna.

53
00:04:45,772 --> 00:04:46,887
Great!

54
00:04:47,332 --> 00:04:50,290
Is it vegetarian?
Because Susan doesn't eat meat.

55
00:04:52,332 --> 00:04:54,482
I'm pretty sure that it is.

56
00:04:56,412 --> 00:04:59,165
So I got the results
of the amnio today.

57
00:04:59,372 --> 00:05:00,600
Tell me.
Is everything. . .?

58
00:05:00,812 --> 00:05:02,165
Totally and completely healthy.

59
00:05:02,372 --> 00:05:04,681
That's great! That is great!

60
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:12,486
When did you and Susan
meet Huey Lewis?

61
00:05:12,732 --> 00:05:14,688
That's our friend Tanya.

62
00:05:23,932 --> 00:05:26,082
Of course, it's your friend Tanya.

63
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:29,765
Don't you wanna know
about the sex?

64
00:05:30,572 --> 00:05:31,766
The sex?

65
00:05:33,852 --> 00:05:37,288
I'm having enough trouble with
the image of you and Susan together.

66
00:05:37,532 --> 00:05:39,807
But when you throw in Tanya. . . .

67
00:05:42,532 --> 00:05:44,488
The sex of the baby, Ross.

68
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:48,041
You know it?

69
00:05:50,332 --> 00:05:51,890
Do you want to know?

70
00:05:52,212 --> 00:05:54,282
I don't want to know.
Absolutely not.

71
00:05:54,532 --> 00:05:57,205
I think you shouldn't know until
you look down there. . .

72
00:05:57,452 --> 00:05:59,283
. . .and see,
''Oh, there it is. . . ''

73
00:05:59,972 --> 00:06:01,291
. . .or isn't.

74
00:06:04,052 --> 00:06:06,282
-Hello, Ross.
-Susan.

75
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,328
So?

76
00:06:08,172 --> 00:06:09,366
So did you hear?

77
00:06:09,572 --> 00:06:11,563
Yes, we did.
Everything's A-OK.

78
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:14,240
Oh, that's so cool!

79
00:06:15,532 --> 00:06:16,806
It really is.

80
00:06:17,332 --> 00:06:18,287
Do we know?

81
00:06:18,532 --> 00:06:21,285
We certainly do.
It's going to be a--

82
00:06:21,692 --> 00:06:22,522
Hello?

83
00:06:22,932 --> 00:06:25,366
A guy who doesn't wanna know
is standing here.

84
00:06:27,332 --> 00:06:30,324
Well, is it what
we thought it would be?

85
00:06:36,732 --> 00:06:38,245
What. . .?

86
00:06:38,692 --> 00:06:39,920
What did we think it'd be?

87
00:06:41,492 --> 00:06:43,687
I don't want to know.
Don't want to know.

88
00:06:43,932 --> 00:06:45,729
I should probably just go.

89
00:06:46,252 --> 00:06:48,288
-Well, thanks for the books.
-No problem.

90
00:06:52,652 --> 00:06:53,767
Susan.

91
00:06:58,972 --> 00:07:03,204
Who should we call first?
Your folks or Deb and Rhona?

92
00:07:10,132 --> 00:07:12,088
Never mind.
I don 't wanna know.

93
00:07:13,532 --> 00:07:16,524
So just because it was my table,
I have to buy a new one?

94
00:07:16,772 --> 00:07:17,568
That's the rule.

95
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,124
What rule?
There's no rule.

96
00:07:21,372 --> 00:07:22,771
If anything, you owe me a table.

97
00:07:23,132 --> 00:07:23,928
How did you get that?

98
00:07:24,132 --> 00:07:26,009
This piece of furniture
was fine. . .

99
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:28,931
. . .until your breakfast adventure
with Angela Delveccio.

100
00:07:29,772 --> 00:07:30,807
You knew about that?

101
00:07:31,012 --> 00:07:34,448
The impressions you made in the butter
left little to the imagination.

102
00:07:35,972 --> 00:07:37,690
How about if we split it?

103
00:07:38,732 --> 00:07:40,643
What do you mean,
like, buy it together?

104
00:07:42,132 --> 00:07:43,690
Do you think we're ready for that?

105
00:07:45,092 --> 00:07:45,888
Why not?

106
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,090
It's a big commitment.
What if one of us wants to move out?

107
00:07:50,172 --> 00:07:52,128
-Are you moving out?
-I'm not moving out.

108
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:53,646
You'd tell me if you were?

109
00:07:54,452 --> 00:07:59,048
-It's just, with my last roommate--
-I know all about Kip.

110
00:07:59,252 --> 00:08:02,289
We bought a hibachi together,
then he ran off and got married. . .

111
00:08:02,492 --> 00:08:03,368
. . .and things got ugly.

112
00:08:04,372 --> 00:08:06,283
Let me ask you something.

113
00:08:06,572 --> 00:08:08,051
Was Kip a better roommate than me?

114
00:08:09,052 --> 00:08:09,848
Don't do that.

115
00:08:16,772 --> 00:08:18,649
You've got a couple changes
in your schedule.

116
00:08:18,972 --> 00:08:22,009
Your 4:00 herbal massage
has been pushed back to 4:30.

117
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:25,130
And Ms. Summerfield
canceled her 5:30 shiatsu.

118
00:08:25,332 --> 00:08:26,481
Thanks.

119
00:08:27,372 --> 00:08:28,646
Here comes your 3:00.

120
00:08:28,852 --> 00:08:31,525
I don't mean to sound
unprofessional, but-- Yum!

121
00:08:36,572 --> 00:08:39,291
Paolo! Hi!
What are you doing here?

122
00:08:41,332 --> 00:08:44,608
Rachella tell me you. . .

123
00:08:45,332 --> 00:08:46,162
. . .massage?

124
00:08:46,732 --> 00:08:48,927
Well, Rachella's right.

125
00:08:54,972 --> 00:08:56,963
I don't know what you said,
so let's start.

126
00:08:59,532 --> 00:09:00,567
I am. . .

127
00:09:01,572 --> 00:09:03,449
. . .being naked?

128
00:09:03,732 --> 00:09:04,960
That's your decision.

129
00:09:05,172 --> 00:09:07,367
Some people prefer to take off--

130
00:09:09,372 --> 00:09:10,521
Being naked!

131
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:14,924
I can't believe you don't want to know.
I couldn't not know.

132
00:09:15,172 --> 00:09:18,642
If the doctor knows,
and Carol knows, and Susan knows--

133
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:19,722
And Monica knows.

134
00:09:21,772 --> 00:09:23,091
How could you?
I don't even know.

135
00:09:23,332 --> 00:09:25,129
Carol called to thank me
for the lasagna.

136
00:09:25,372 --> 00:09:26,885
I asked. She told me.

137
00:09:27,172 --> 00:09:28,605
So what's it going to be?

138
00:09:31,732 --> 00:09:33,450
Great! Now he knows
and I don't know.

139
00:09:33,652 --> 00:09:35,882
I'm sorry. I'm excited
about being an aunt.

140
00:09:36,132 --> 00:09:37,281
Or an uncle.

141
00:09:44,892 --> 00:09:45,688
Fine!

142
00:09:48,972 --> 00:09:49,802
What's the matter?

143
00:09:50,012 --> 00:09:52,890
Nothing! I'm sorry.
I'm just, I'm out of sorts.

144
00:09:53,132 --> 00:09:55,123
Can we get some
cappuccino over here?

145
00:09:56,692 --> 00:09:58,284
Oh, right! That's me!

146
00:09:59,772 --> 00:10:02,730
That table place closes at 7. Come on.

147
00:10:02,972 --> 00:10:04,087
Fine.

148
00:10:05,852 --> 00:10:06,887
What is it?

149
00:10:08,532 --> 00:10:09,408
You know Paolo?

150
00:10:09,612 --> 00:10:11,921
I'm familiar with his work.

151
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:14,406
He made a move on me.

152
00:10:15,172 --> 00:10:17,561
-The store'll be open tomorrow.
-More coffee.

153
00:10:24,932 --> 00:10:26,206
What happened?

154
00:10:26,452 --> 00:10:28,124
He came in for a massage. . .

155
00:10:28,372 --> 00:10:30,283
...and everything was fine until....

156
00:10:34,492 --> 00:10:35,288
My God!

157
00:10:35,532 --> 00:10:36,601
Are you sure?

158
00:10:37,732 --> 00:10:38,881
Oh, yeah. I'm sure.

159
00:10:43,572 --> 00:10:47,281
And all of a sudden, his hands
weren't the problem anymore.

160
00:10:51,332 --> 00:10:52,128
Was it. . .?

161
00:10:52,372 --> 00:10:54,886
Boy Scouts could've
camped under there.

162
00:10:56,932 --> 00:10:58,411
''Ooh,'' what?

163
00:10:58,652 --> 00:10:59,687
--ma Thurman.

164
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,883
-The actress!
-Uma Thurman!

165
00:11:03,252 --> 00:11:04,048
Thanks, Rach.

166
00:11:07,132 --> 00:11:08,850
-What'll you do?
-You have to tell her.

167
00:11:09,092 --> 00:11:11,481
You have to! It's your
moral obligation as a friend. . .

168
00:11:11,732 --> 00:11:13,324
. . .as a woman.
It's a feminist issue.

169
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:15,085
Guys? Guys?

170
00:11:15,332 --> 00:11:17,004
You have to tell her.

171
00:11:17,252 --> 00:11:18,571
Feminist issue?
That's where I went.

172
00:11:20,532 --> 00:11:21,726
She is gonna hate me!

173
00:11:30,572 --> 00:11:32,528
Will you pick one?
Just pick one.

174
00:11:32,772 --> 00:11:34,046
Here, how about that one?

175
00:11:34,772 --> 00:11:36,683
That's patio furniture.

176
00:11:37,172 --> 00:11:37,968
So what?

177
00:11:38,172 --> 00:11:41,448
Like people will come in and think,
''Uh-oh, I'm outside again. ''

178
00:11:41,652 --> 00:11:42,687
Fine.

179
00:11:43,252 --> 00:11:44,890
What about the birds?

180
00:11:46,252 --> 00:11:47,731
I don't know.
Birds just don't say. . .

181
00:11:47,972 --> 00:11:50,611
. . . ''Hello, sit here. Eat something. ''

182
00:11:51,652 --> 00:11:53,085
You pick one.

183
00:11:53,332 --> 00:11:54,606
How about the ladybugs?

184
00:11:54,852 --> 00:11:58,811
So forget about the birds, but
big red insects suggest fine dining?

185
00:11:59,012 --> 00:12:01,162
Fine! Do you want the birds?
Get the birds!

186
00:12:01,372 --> 00:12:03,090
Not like that, I won't.

187
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:07,520
Kip would've liked the birds.

188
00:12:18,852 --> 00:12:19,728
Hi, Pheebs.

189
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:21,082
Are you moving out?

190
00:12:21,332 --> 00:12:23,288
No, these aren't all
of my suitcases.

191
00:12:23,532 --> 00:12:24,885
This one's Paolo's.

192
00:12:28,532 --> 00:12:30,284
Rachel, can we talk for a sec?

193
00:12:31,572 --> 00:12:32,368
Sure.

194
00:12:32,572 --> 00:12:34,881
Just for a sec, because Paolo's
on his way over.

195
00:12:46,652 --> 00:12:49,803
We haven't known each other
for that long a time.

196
00:12:50,012 --> 00:12:51,968
There are three things
you should know about me.

197
00:12:52,492 --> 00:12:55,404
One, my friends are the most
important thing in my life.

198
00:12:56,772 --> 00:12:58,490
Two, I never lie.

199
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:02,807
And three, I make the best
oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.

200
00:13:07,332 --> 00:13:08,208
Thanks, Pheebs.

201
00:13:13,252 --> 00:13:14,765
My God!

202
00:13:15,972 --> 00:13:18,008
Why have I never tasted these before?

203
00:13:18,212 --> 00:13:21,921
I don't make them a lot, because
it's not fair to the other cookies.

204
00:13:28,772 --> 00:13:31,730
You're right. These are
the best oatmeal raisin cookies.

205
00:13:31,932 --> 00:13:33,411
Which proves that I never lie.

206
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,330
I guess you don't.

207
00:13:35,852 --> 00:13:37,171
Paolo made a pass at me.

208
00:13:40,372 --> 00:13:41,691
So what do you think?

209
00:13:42,092 --> 00:13:44,287
It's the most beautiful table
I've ever seen.

210
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,362
I know.

211
00:13:45,772 --> 00:13:48,730
So will you balance the plates
on these little heads?

212
00:13:48,972 --> 00:13:50,451
Who cares?
We'll eat at the sink.

213
00:13:50,652 --> 00:13:51,448
Come on!

214
00:13:53,772 --> 00:13:54,727
Heads up, Ross.

215
00:13:55,372 --> 00:13:56,202
Score!

216
00:13:56,452 --> 00:13:57,601
You suck!

217
00:14:00,652 --> 00:14:01,880
Are you okay?

218
00:14:04,932 --> 00:14:06,081
I need some milk.

219
00:14:08,452 --> 00:14:09,726
I've got milk.

220
00:14:15,092 --> 00:14:15,888
Here you go.

221
00:14:24,172 --> 00:14:24,968
Better?

222
00:14:30,652 --> 00:14:33,086
I feel so stupid!

223
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:35,728
I think about the other day
with you guys.

224
00:14:35,972 --> 00:14:39,328
And I was all,
''Oh, Paolo! He's so great!

225
00:14:39,572 --> 00:14:41,085
He makes me feel so--''

226
00:14:41,972 --> 00:14:43,087
God!

227
00:14:43,692 --> 00:14:45,205
I'm so embarrassed!

228
00:14:45,412 --> 00:14:47,130
I'm so embarrassed.

229
00:14:47,372 --> 00:14:48,646
I'm the one he hit on.

230
00:14:48,852 --> 00:14:50,410
Phoebe, I pushed him on you.

231
00:14:50,612 --> 00:14:52,330
If I had never met him,
this would never--

232
00:14:52,532 --> 00:14:54,568
-I'm so sorry.
-No, I'm sorry.

233
00:14:56,292 --> 00:14:57,202
Wait!

234
00:14:57,572 --> 00:14:59,688
-What are we sorry about?
-I don't know.

235
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,843
Right. He's the pig.

236
00:15:02,052 --> 00:15:04,691
-Such a pig!
-Oh, God, he's such a pig!

237
00:15:04,892 --> 00:15:08,202
He's like a big disgusting pig. . . .

238
00:15:08,452 --> 00:15:10,647
-Pig man!
-Yes, good!

239
00:15:14,732 --> 00:15:16,211
But he was my pig man!

240
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:20,922
How did I not see this?

241
00:15:22,412 --> 00:15:23,527
Oh, I know!

242
00:15:26,572 --> 00:15:27,766
Because. . .

243
00:15:28,492 --> 00:15:29,925
. . .he's gorgeous.

244
00:15:30,172 --> 00:15:31,685
And he's charming.

245
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:34,400
And the way he looks at you--

246
00:15:34,612 --> 00:15:35,522
The end.

247
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:39,282
God!

248
00:15:41,332 --> 00:15:43,288
Should I not have told you?

249
00:15:44,052 --> 00:15:47,249
Trust me, it's much better
that I know.

250
00:15:50,332 --> 00:15:54,166
But I just liked it better before.
It was better.

251
00:16:10,252 --> 00:16:11,446
I think she took it pretty well.

252
00:16:12,132 --> 00:16:14,043
Paolo's over there right now, so. . . .

253
00:16:14,252 --> 00:16:16,083
We should go
and see if she's okay.

254
00:16:16,332 --> 00:16:18,482
Just one second.

255
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,608
Score!

256
00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:22,165
Game! Us!

257
00:16:24,212 --> 00:16:25,122
Come on.

258
00:16:28,132 --> 00:16:29,770
It looks like
we kicked your butts.

259
00:16:29,972 --> 00:16:30,927
She kicked our butts.

260
00:16:31,172 --> 00:16:33,845
You could be on the Olympic
''Standing There'' team.

261
00:16:34,252 --> 00:16:35,367
Come on. Two on one.

262
00:16:35,652 --> 00:16:38,086
Why are you still here?
She just broke up with him.

263
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:39,645
It's time for you to swoop in.

264
00:16:41,092 --> 00:16:41,888
What, now?

265
00:16:42,972 --> 00:16:44,121
Now is when you swoop.

266
00:16:44,372 --> 00:16:47,682
When Paolo walks out of there,
you gotta be the first guy she sees.

267
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,282
She's got to know
you're everything he's not.

268
00:16:50,532 --> 00:16:52,488
You're like the anti-Paolo.

269
00:16:54,372 --> 00:16:56,044
My Catholic friend is right.

270
00:16:56,652 --> 00:16:58,483
She's distraught.
You're there for her.

271
00:16:58,732 --> 00:17:01,724
You pick up the pieces, and then
you usher in. . .

272
00:17:01,972 --> 00:17:04,691
. . . ''The Age of Ross. ''

273
00:17:12,372 --> 00:17:13,805
Hold it! Ascolta!

274
00:17:16,852 --> 00:17:18,649
-How's it going?
-Don't stare.

275
00:17:18,852 --> 00:17:21,207
She finished throwing
his clothes off the balcony.

276
00:17:21,412 --> 00:17:23,528
Now there's just
gesturing and arm-waving.

277
00:17:23,812 --> 00:17:27,248
That is either, ''How could you?''
or ''Enormous breasts! ''

278
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:29,928
Here he comes.

279
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:42,080
I am. . .

280
00:17:42,772 --> 00:17:44,091
. . .to say goodbye.

281
00:17:44,932 --> 00:17:46,081
Okay, bye-bye.

282
00:17:50,972 --> 00:17:52,564
I hate you
for what you did to Rachel.

283
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:54,490
But I still have five of these. . .

284
00:17:54,732 --> 00:17:57,121
. . .so heat it at 375
untiI the cheese bubbles.

285
00:18:01,972 --> 00:18:03,291
I just wanna tell you. . .

286
00:18:03,532 --> 00:18:06,922
. . .and I think I'd speak
for everyone when I say. . . .

287
00:18:13,572 --> 00:18:14,891
Just look at her.

288
00:18:15,132 --> 00:18:17,885
Guys, I think only one of us
should go out there. . .

289
00:18:18,092 --> 00:18:19,923
-. . .so she's not overwhelmed.
-Right.

290
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,088
And I really think it should be me.

291
00:18:38,252 --> 00:18:39,048
You all right?

292
00:18:41,732 --> 00:18:43,290
I've been better.

293
00:18:47,132 --> 00:18:48,201
Come here.

294
00:18:55,252 --> 00:18:56,048
Listen. . .

295
00:18:56,772 --> 00:18:59,684
. . .you deserve
so much better than him.

296
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:00,808
I mean, you. . .

297
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:05,682
. . .you should be with a guy who knows
what he has when he has you.

298
00:19:09,652 --> 00:19:10,528
What?

299
00:19:11,572 --> 00:19:14,086
I'm so sick of guys!

300
00:19:14,772 --> 00:19:16,808
I don't want to look
at another guy.

301
00:19:17,052 --> 00:19:19,088
I don't want to think
about another guy.

302
00:19:19,332 --> 00:19:22,290
I don't even want
to be near another guy.

303
00:19:29,572 --> 00:19:31,483
Ross, you're so great.

304
00:19:42,972 --> 00:19:44,371
-Are you all right?
-Are you okay?

305
00:19:45,172 --> 00:19:46,491
Medium.

306
00:19:46,932 --> 00:19:48,684
Any cookies left?

307
00:19:51,852 --> 00:19:52,887
See, Rach. . .

308
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:57,370
. . .I don't think swearing off guys
altogether is the answer.

309
00:19:57,572 --> 00:20:02,043
What you need is to develop a more
sophisticated screening process.

310
00:20:03,532 --> 00:20:06,092
I just need to be
by myself for a while.

311
00:20:06,332 --> 00:20:08,004
I just gotta
figure out what I want.

312
00:20:10,572 --> 00:20:14,565
See, because not all guys out there
are gonna be a Paolo.

313
00:20:14,772 --> 00:20:16,490
No, I know. I know.

314
00:20:16,692 --> 00:20:20,480
And I'm sure your little boy's
not gonna grow up to be one.

315
00:20:21,292 --> 00:20:22,088
What?

316
00:20:22,372 --> 00:20:23,168
What?

317
00:20:26,332 --> 00:20:27,401
I'm having a boy?

318
00:20:31,092 --> 00:20:33,925
No. In fact,
you're not having a boy.

319
00:20:34,332 --> 00:20:36,084
I'm having a boy.

320
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:38,601
Am I having a boy?

321
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:41,283
You're having a boy!

322
00:20:41,732 --> 00:20:42,926
I'm having a boy!

323
00:20:43,172 --> 00:20:44,127
I'm having a boy!

324
00:20:44,332 --> 00:20:45,128
-What?
-What is it?

325
00:20:45,332 --> 00:20:46,367
I'm having a boy!

326
00:20:51,372 --> 00:20:52,930
We already knew that!

327
00:20:56,252 --> 00:20:57,685
I'm having a son.

328
00:21:06,972 --> 00:21:08,610
And that would be a shutdown!

329
00:21:08,812 --> 00:21:10,006
Shutout!

330
00:21:13,252 --> 00:21:15,766
Where you guys going?
Come on, one more game!

331
00:21:15,972 --> 00:21:17,883
It's 2:30 in the morning.

332
00:21:18,132 --> 00:21:19,087
Get out!

333
00:21:19,492 --> 00:21:22,325
You guys are always hanging out
in my apartment.

334
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:24,927
Come on, I'll only use
my left hand.

335
00:21:25,172 --> 00:21:27,128
Come on, wussies!

336
00:21:30,772 --> 00:21:32,888
All right! Okay!
I gotta go!

337
00:21:33,372 --> 00:21:34,487
I'm going.

338
00:21:34,932 --> 00:21:36,285
And I'm gone.

339
00:21:39,012 --> 00:21:39,888
One more game?



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
