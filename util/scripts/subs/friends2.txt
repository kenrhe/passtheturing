00:00:01,868 --> 00:00:03,301
You don't understand.

2
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:06,529
For us, kissing is as
important as any part.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,207
Yeah, right!

4
00:00:10,877 --> 00:00:12,071
You serious?

5
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:14,068
Oh, yeah.

6
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:17,750
- Everything is in that first kiss.
- Absolutely.

7
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:20,511
For us, kissing's an opening act..

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,848
like the comedian
you have to sit through..

9
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:26,082
before Pink Floyd comes out.

10
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:32,593
And it's not that
we don't like the comedian.

11
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:37,963
It's just that that's not
why we bought the ticket.

12
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:44,005
The problem is, no matter
how great the show was..

13
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:47,736
you girls are looking
for the comedian again.

14
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:52,883
We're in the car, fighting traffic,
just trying to stay awake.

15
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,789
Word of advice:
Bring back the comedian.

16
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:02,723
Or next time you'll find yourself
listening to that album alone.

17
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:09,868
Are we still talking about sex?

18
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:13,297
The One With the Sonogram at the End

19
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:03,355
No, it's good. It is good.

20
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:07,185
It's just that Doesn't she seem
a little angry?

21
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:08,724
Well, she has issues.

22
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:11,655
Does she?

23
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:14,390
Try to live with "Mr. I'm Evolving."

24
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:21,664
He's out while she's home getting
the mastodon smell out of the carpet.

25
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,236
Marsha, see, these are cave people.

26
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:28,441
Okay, they have issues like:

27
00:02:28,915 --> 00:02:32,282
"Gee, that glacier's
getting kind of close."

28
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,818
Speaking of issues,
isn't that your ex-wife?

29
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:37,853
- No.
- Yes, it is. Carol, hi!

30
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:42,220
Okay. Yes, it is.
I'll catch up with you in the Ice Age.

31
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:44,157
- Can I stay?
- No.

32
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:00,506
- Hi.
- Hi.

33
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:11,052
- Is this a bad time?
- No, it's..

34
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:13,487
the Stone Age.

35
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:19,495
You look great. I hate that.

36
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,801
Sorry. Thanks. You look good too.

37
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:26,631
Well, you know,
in here, anyone who..

38
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:29,739
stands erect..

39
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,980
- What's new? Still a
- A lesbian?

40
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:41,615
You never know. How's the family?

41
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:47,049
- Marty's still totally paranoid.
- Carol, why are you here?

42
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:51,591
- I'm pregnant.
- Pregnant.

43
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,697
She didn't leave
in such a hurry after all.

44
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:07,608
This is the Three's Company episode
with a misunderstanding.

45
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,317
Then I've already seen this one.

46
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,115
Are you through with that?

47
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:19,085
Sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.

48
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,257
Whose ball of paper is this?

49
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:26,397
Mine. I wrote a note to myself,
then I didn't need it.

50
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,625
So I balled it up
and now I wish I was dead.

51
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:36,198
She already fluffed that pillow.
You already fluffed It's fine.

52
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:40,339
I just don't wanna give them
any more ammunition.

53
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:44,676
Parents can be cruel about
the flatness of a child's pillow.

54
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:49,752
Relax, you do this every time.
The place looks great.

55
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:53,448
You got a lasagna here
that looks good enough..

56
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,321
to avoid touching.

57
00:04:58,665 --> 00:04:59,927
Monica? Hi!

58
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:04,336
Monica, you're scaring me.

59
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:09,039
I mean, you're all chaotic
and twirly, you know?

60
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:10,669
Not in a good way.

61
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:18,381
Calm down. You don't see Ross
getting twirly every time they come.

62
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:22,349
That's because my parents think
Ross can do no wrong.

63
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:24,420
You see, he's "The Prince."

64
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:28,149
They had some big ceremony
before I was born.

65
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:34,460
- What?
- Ugly Naked Guy got a ThighMaster.

66
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:42,908
- Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
- It's beautiful.

67
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:51,045
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

68
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,047
No, don't touch that.

69
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:59,858
Like I wasn't dreading tomorrow
enough, having to give it back.

70
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:05,224
"Hi, Barry, remember me? I'm the girl
that stomped on your heart."

71
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:08,662
Now I must return the ring
without the ring..

72
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,803
which makes it so much harder.

73
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:14,698
Easy, we'll find it. Won't we?

74
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:18,801
Look, it's gonna be okay.
You'll give it back..

75
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:23,072
- and we'll eat ice cream.
- Okay. It's a pear-shaped diamond

76
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:26,445
Any diamond ring we find,
we'll run it by you.

77
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:32,623
- When did you have it last?
- Doy, right before she lost it.

78
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:37,722
You don't get
a lot of "doy" these days.

79
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,931
I know I had it this morning.

80
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:45,263
I know I had it when I was
in the kitchen with

81
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,902
Dinah?

82
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:53,300
- Oh, don't be mad.
- You didn't.

83
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:57,779
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I gave you one job!

84
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,780
But look how straight
those noodles are.

85
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:07,184
That's not how you look
for an engagement ring in a lasagna.

86
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,062
I just can't do it.

87
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,993
Boys? We're going in.

88
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,433
Hi.

89
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:30,747
- That is not a happy "hi."
- Carol's pregnant.

90
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,417
I found it!

91
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:37,850
What?

92
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:39,452
Yeah.

93
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:45,123
Do that for two hours, you might
be where I am about now.

94
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:49,295
That puts that whole
pillow thing in perspective.

95
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,105
How do you fit into this whole thing?

96
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:57,035
Carol and Susan want me
to be involved.

97
00:07:57,243 --> 00:08:01,907
But if I'm not comfortable with it,
I don't have to be involved.

98
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:06,482
- It's totally up to me.
- She is so great. I miss her.

99
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:15,925
- What does she mean by "involved"?
- Your job is done.

100
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,793
And the most enjoyable.

101
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:23,634
Phoebe, say something.

102
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,203
They want me to go down
to this sonogram thing..

103
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:29,033
with them tomorrow.

104
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:31,369
Remember when life was simpler..

105
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:34,011
and she was just a lesbian?

106
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,581
Those were the days.

107
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:41,679
- What are you gonna do?
- I have no idea.

108
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:45,654
No matter what I do,
I'm still gonna be a father.

109
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:57,831
This is still ruined, right?

110
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:07,144
Martha Lugwin's daughter
is gonna call you.

111
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:13,578
- What's that curry taste?
- Curry.

112
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,950
I think they're great. I really do.

113
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:24,287
The big Lugwin had a thing for you.

114
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:27,989
- They all had a thing for him.
- Oh, Mom.

115
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:30,497
Why is this girl going to call me?

116
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:36,573
She just graduated, and she wants
to be something in cooking or food..

117
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:39,209
I told her you have a restaurant

118
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:44,042
- I don't have, I work in a restaurant.
- They don't have to know that.

119
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,615
- Ross, help me with the spaghetti.
- Yes.

120
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:55,521
Oh, we're having spaghetti.
That's easy.

121
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:58,630
We were going to have lasagna.

122
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:01,766
- I love lasagna.
- We're not having it.

123
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,862
Then why bring it up? He latches on.

124
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:10,805
This will sound unbelievably selfish..

125
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,776
but did you plan to bring
up the baby/lesbian thing?

126
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,506
It might take the heat off of me.

127
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,317
That Rachel.
We saw her parents at the club.

128
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:26,616
They were not playing well.

129
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:29,021
I won't say what they spent..

130
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,786
but $40,000 is a lot for a wedding.

131
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:38,636
At least she had the chance
to leave a man at the altar.

132
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:44,543
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

133
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,902
- It's an expression.
- No, it's not.

134
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:51,413
Don't listen to her.
You've always been independent.

135
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:54,049
Even when you were a chubby kid..

136
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:57,381
and you had no friends,
you were just fine.

137
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:02,088
You'd read alone in your room.
Your puzzles..

138
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:09,599
People like Ross need
to shoot for the stars.

139
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,668
With his museum
and his published papers.

140
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:16,306
Others are satisfied with
staying where they are.

141
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,943
These people never get cancer.

142
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,139
They're happy with what
they have, content..

143
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,374
like cows.

144
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:28,652
Cows, Dad?

145
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,952
She knows how much I love cows.

146
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:38,556
I read about women trying
to have it all, and I thank God..

147
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:41,823
our "Harmonica"
doesn't have that problem.

148
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:47,999
- I'm telling you, you'll be fine.
- Thank you, Daddy.

149
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:52,205
Oh, so this does work.

150
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,842
So, Ross, what's going on with you?

151
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:03,820
Any stories? No news, no little
anecdotes to share with the folks?

152
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:10,694
Look, I realize you guys
have been wondering..

153
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,990
what exactly happened
between Carol and me.

154
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,964
And so, well, here's the deal.

155
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:20,437
Carol's a lesbian.

156
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,939
She lives with a woman named Susan.

157
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:29,542
She's pregnant with my child.

158
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:33,541
She and Susan are
going to raise the baby.

159
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:39,214
And you knew about this?

160
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,027
Folks are really that bad?

161
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:52,796
Well, you know, these people are pros.

162
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:56,497
They know what they do.

163
00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:00,736
They take their time.
They get the job done.

164
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:05,476
They say that you can't change
your parents.

165
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:08,879
Boy, if you could, I'd want yours.

166
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:11,678
Must pee.

167
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:15,292
It's worse when you're twins.

168
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:17,485
- You're a twin?
- We don't speak.

169
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:20,688
She's this high-powered,
driven, career-type.

170
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,733
- What does she do?
- She's a waitress.

171
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,630
- Identical?
- People say we look alike.

172
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,205
But I don't see it.

173
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:33,336
You guys, I kind of
gotta clean up now.

174
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:36,447
Chandler, as an only child,
you don't have this.

175
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,982
No, although I did have
an imaginary friend..

176
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:42,049
who my parents preferred.

177
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,417
Hit the lights, please.

178
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,396
How long was I in there?

179
00:13:56,468 --> 00:14:00,996
- I'm just cleaning up.
- Oh, you need any help?

180
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:04,332
Okay, sure. Thanks.

181
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:11,073
Anyway..

182
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,347
So you nervous
about Barry tomorrow?

183
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,253
A little.

184
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:20,422
A lot.

185
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,185
So, got any advice?

186
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,627
You know, as someone
who's recently been dumped.

187
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:32,328
You may wanna steer clear
of the word "dumped."

188
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:37,870
Chances are he's gonna be
this broken shell of a man.

189
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:43,412
You should try not to look
too terrific. I know it'll be hard.

190
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:49,952
Or I'll go down there,
and I'll give Barry back his ring.

191
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:54,818
And you can go with Carol
and Susan to the ob-gyn.

192
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,220
You've got Carol tomorrow.

193
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:03,762
- When did it get so complicated?
- Got me.

194
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,098
- Remember being in high school?
- Yeah.

195
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:09,866
Didn't you think you'd meet someone..

196
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,475
fall in love, and that'd be it?

197
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:19,848
- Ross?
- Yes. Yes.

198
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:26,256
Man, I never thought I'd be here.

199
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,188
Me neither.

200
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,915
Sorry I'm late. I got stuck at work.

201
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:57,714
There was this big
dinosaur thing. Anyway..

202
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,379
Hi.

203
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:03,924
- You remember Susan.
- How could I forget?

204
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,892
Hello, Susan.
Good shake, good shake.

205
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,767
So, we're just waiting for?

206
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,304
- Dr. Oberman.
- And is he?

207
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:17,475
- She.
- Of course, "she."

208
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:23,171
Is she familiar with our
special situation?

209
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:27,545
- Yes, and she's very supportive.
- Okay, that's great.

210
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,282
No, I'm Oh.

211
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:33,055
Thanks.

212
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:54,940
That opens my cervix.

213
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,711
- Barry?
- Come on in.

214
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,581
- Are you sure?
- It's fine.

215
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,987
Robbie's gonna be here for hours.

216
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,393
So, how are you doing?

217
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:16,590
I'm..

218
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:19,302
I'm okay.

219
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:23,268
- You look great.
- Yeah, well.

220
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,444
Dr. Farber, Jason Greenspan's gagging.

221
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:29,511
Be right there. Be back in a second.

222
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,482
I dumped him.

223
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,037
So, how's this all gonna work?

224
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:01,076
The baby grows
in a special place inside

225
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,338
Thank you.

226
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:06,712
I mean, how's this gonna work,
you know, with us?

227
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:10,021
When important decisions
have to be made?

228
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:13,688
- Give me a "for instance."
- Well, I don't know.

229
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:17,328
- How about with the baby's name?
- Marlon.

230
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:20,123
If it's a boy. Minnie, if it's a girl.

231
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:23,826
As in "Mouse"?

232
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,701
As in my grandmother.

233
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:30,701
Still, you say "Minnie,"
you hear "Mouse."

234
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:34,372
How about..?

235
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,346
How about Julia?

236
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:39,742
- Julia.
- We agreed on Minnie.

237
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,614
We agreed we'd spend
our lives together.

238
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:45,517
Things change.
Roll with the punches.

239
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,226
I believe Julia's on the table?

240
00:18:51,196 --> 00:18:52,720
Sorry about that.

241
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:58,327
So, what have you been up to?

242
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:00,937
Oh, not much.

243
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:04,098
- I got a job.
- That's great.

244
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:06,968
Why are you so tan?

245
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:11,916
I went to Aruba.

246
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:14,847
Oh, no. You went
on our honeymoon alone?

247
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,212
No.

248
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:21,420
I went with..

249
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:24,624
- Now, this may hurt.
- Me?

250
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,922
No.

251
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:29,993
I went with Mindy.

252
00:19:30,702 --> 00:19:31,828
Mindy?

253
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,566
My maid of honor, Mindy?

254
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:37,708
Yeah, we're kind of a thing now.

255
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:43,978
You got plugs!

256
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,050
Careful. They haven't quite taken yet.

257
00:19:47,452 --> 00:19:49,283
And you got lenses.

258
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:53,023
You hate sticking your finger
in your eye.

259
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:54,692
Not for her.

260
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:01,055
Listen, I really wanted to thank you.

261
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,190
Okay.

262
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:08,837
A month ago, I wanted to hurt you
more than I've ever wanted to.

263
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,032
And I'm an orthodontist.

264
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:16,472
You know, you were right.
I thought we were happy.

265
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,546
We weren't happy.

266
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,319
But with Mindy..

267
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,885
now I'm happy.

268
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:26,385
- Spit.
- What?

269
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:28,059
Me.

270
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,927
Anyway..

271
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:38,261
I guess this belongs to you.
Or maybe some day Mindy.

272
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,870
Like she'd settle for that.

273
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:47,273
Yeah, that's true.

274
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:51,176
But I think it's a nice ring..

275
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:55,251
and thank you for giving it to me.

276
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:58,420
Thank you for giving it back.

277
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,158
Hello!

278
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:09,267
- Please, what's wrong with Helen?
- Helen Geller?

279
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:14,094
- I don't think so.
- It's not gonna be Helen Geller.

280
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:17,537
- Thank you.
- No, I mean, it's not Geller.

281
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,910
It'll be Helen Willick?

282
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:25,576
No, actually, we talked about
Helen Willick Bunch.

283
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,614
Wait a minute.
Why is she in the title?

284
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:31,253
It's my baby too.

285
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:34,653
Really? I don't remember
you making any sperm.

286
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:40,024
And we all know what
a challenge that is.

287
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,599
- You two, stop it.
- She gets a credit. I'm in there too.

288
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:50,537
Helen Willick Bunch Geller?
I think that borders on child abuse.

289
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:54,610
Of course not.
I'm suggesting Geller Willick Bunch.

290
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:59,216
See what he does? He knows no one's
gonna say all those names.

291
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:01,976
They'll call her Geller.
He gets his way.

292
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:04,348
My way? You think this is my way?

293
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:08,151
Of all the ways I ever imagined
this moment being..

294
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:12,022
this is not my You know what?
This is too hard.

295
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,960
Knock, knock. How are we? Any nausea?

296
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,067
- A little.
- Just a little.

297
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:23,673
I was wondering about the
mother-to-be, but thanks for sharing.

298
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:27,367
- Lie back.
- You know what? I'm gonna go.

299
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:31,948
I don't think I can be involved
in this family thing.

300
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:45,490
- Oh, my God!
- Look at that.

301
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:47,198
I know.

302
00:22:57,609 --> 00:22:59,770
Well, isn't that amazing?

303
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:05,681
What are we supposed to be
seeing here?

304
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:11,415
I don't know, but I think it's about
to attack the Enterprise.

305
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:17,661
If you tilt your head
and relax your eyes..

306
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:20,730
it kind of looks
like an old potato.

307
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,834
Then don't do that, all right?

308
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:28,729
Monica, what do you think?

309
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:33,704
- Are you welling up?
- No.

310
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:37,211
- You are. You're welling up.
- I'm not.

311
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,976
- You're gonna be an aunt.
- Oh, shut up.

312
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:45,354
Hi, Mindy. Hi, it's Rachel.

313
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:49,323
Yeah, I'm fine. I saw Barry today.

314
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:54,192
Yeah, he told me. No, it's okay.
Really, it's okay.

315
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:57,958
I hope you two are very happy.
I really do.

316
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:01,932
And, Min, you know,
if everything works out..

317
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,940
and you guys get married
and have kids..

318
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:09,306
I hope they have his hairline
and your nose!

319
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:18,379
That was a cheap shot,
but I feel so much better now!
