00:00:01,067 --> 00:00:04,994
Everybody! Central Perk
is proud to present...

2
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:09,141
...the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.

3
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:12,700
Thanks.

4
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:16,637
I wanna start with a song
that's about that moment...

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:21,184
...when you suddenly realize
what life is really all about.

6
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:23,788
Okay, here we go.

7
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:29,154
Okay. Thank you very much.

8
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:44,376
Oh, great. This is just

9
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,446
The One With The Blackout

10
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:44,467
This is so cool, you guys.
The entire city's blacked out.

11
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:47,504
It's all of Manhattan.
They have no idea...

12
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:49,572
...when it's back on.

13
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:54,042
-You guys, this is big.
-Pants and a sweater. Why, Mom?

14
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:56,742
Who will I meet in a blackout?

15
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:01,116
Power-company guys?
Eligible looters?

16
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:05,454
-Can we talk about this later? Okay.
-Can I borrow the phone?

17
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:09,150
I wanna call my apartment
and check on my grandma.

18
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:10,693
What's my number?

19
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:14,332
I never call me.

20
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:19,871
Oh, my God! It's her.
It's that Victoria 's Secret model.

21
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:21,370
Something Goodacre.

22
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:22,939
Hi, Mom, it's Jill.

23
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:27,739
She 's right. It's Jill.
Jill Goodacre. Oh, my God!

24
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:31,849
I am trapped in an A TM vestibule
with Jill Goodacre.

25
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:35,819
Is it a vestibule?
Maybe it's an atrium.

26
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:39,985
Yeah, that is the part
to focus on, you idiot.

27
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:45,154
I' m fine. I' m just stuck
at the bank in an ATM vestibule.

28
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:49,495
Jill says vestibule,
I'm going with vestibule.

29
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:53,731
I' m fine. No, l' m not alone.

30
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,032
I don't know, some guy.

31
00:02:56,242 --> 00:03:00,508
Oh, some guy. I am some guy.

32
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:03,409
Jill, I saw you with some guy
last night.

33
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,448
Yes, he was some guy.

34
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,086
Hey, everyone.

35
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:27,638
Officiating at tonight's blackout
is Rabbi T ribbiani.

36
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,372
Chandler's old roommate was Jewish.
These are our only candles.

37
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:36,810
So happy Hanukkah!

38
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:42,285
Look! Ugly Naked Guy
lit a bunch of candles.

39
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,721
That had to hurt!

40
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,999
All right, all right!
It's been 14 1/2 minutes...

41
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,069
...and you still haven 't said
one word. God!

42
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:02,867
Do something!
Just make contact. Smile!

43
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:08,169
There you go.

44
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,146
You 're definitely scaring her.

45
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,859
Hello? Oh, hi, Mom.

46
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,152
Mom.

47
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:25,159
Mom, you' re tripping!

48
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,191
Dexter's a dog.
The blackout's scaring him.

49
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:34,767
You'd pee in Dad's shoes too
if you didn't know.

50
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,938
All right, call me back.

51
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,434
-Mothers.
-Yeah.

52
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:43,616
Attaboy! A word.

53
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:46,444
That wasn 't so hard.
Mothers. Yeah!

54
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:49,417
Mothers. Yeah! Perfect.

55
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:52,221
Don 't smile.

56
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:55,686
Would you like to call somebody?

57
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:59,795
Yeah, about 300 guys I went
to high school with.

58
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,938
Yeah, thanks.

59
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,244
-Hello?
-It's me.

60
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:16,472
-It's Chandler. Are you okay?
-Yeah, l' m fine.

61
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:20,983
I' m stuck in an ATM vestibule...

62
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:25,014
...with Jill Goodacre.

63
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:29,056
-What?
-l' m stuck...

64
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:32,256
...in an ATM vestibule...

65
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:34,626
...with Jill Goodacre.

66
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:37,767
I have no idea what you said.

67
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,835
Put Joey on the phone.

68
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:45,574
-What's up, man?
-l' m stuck...

69
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,937
...in an ATM vestibule...

70
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:52,517
...with Jill Goodacre!

71
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,611
Oh, my God!

72
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:58,220
He's trapped in an ATM vestibule
with Jill Goodacre!

73
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:01,453
Chandler, listen.

74
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,856
Like that thought
never entered my mind.

75
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:12,895
-Okay.
-Somebody.

76
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,136
-I'll go. I'll go.
-Okay.

77
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:19,107
Senior year of college,
on a pool table.

78
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:22,738
-Pool table?
-That's my sister.

79
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:27,611
Okay, my weirdest place
would have to be...

80
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:32,621
...the women's room of the New York
City Public Library.

81
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:35,760
Oh, my God! What were you
doing in a library?

82
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:41,799
-Pheebs, what about you?
-Oh, Milwaukee.

83
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,405
It's a really weird place.

84
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:51,768
Ross?

85
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:57,371
Disneyland, 1 989.
" It's a small world after all. "

86
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:00,845
No way.

87
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:02,577
The ride broke down...

88
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:08,056
...so Carol and I went behind
those mechanical Dutch children.

89
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:12,595
We were asked never to return
to the Magic Kingdom.

90
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:17,566
Let's see, that leaves....

91
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,466
-Rachel?
-Come on, I already went.

92
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:22,106
-You did not go.
-I did.

93
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:24,342
T ell us. Come on.

94
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:29,777
All right, the weirdest place
would have to be...

95
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,112
...the foot of the bed.

96
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:38,115
-Step back!
-We have a winner!

97
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:51,097
This must be what the fridge
looks like with the door closed.

98
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,328
Spooky.

99
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:58,701
Anybody hungry?
We got a Klondike...soup.

100
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:03,314
I've never had a relationship
with that kind of passion.

101
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:07,077
Where you have to have somebody
even in a theme park.

102
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,614
It was the only thing to do
that didn't have a line.

103
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:19,397
Barry wouldn't even kiss me
on a miniature golf course.

104
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,657
-Come on.
-No.

105
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:23,427
He said we held up
the people behind us.

106
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,465
You didn't marry him because...?

107
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:31,808
Do you think there are people
that go through life...

108
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,605
... never having that kind of...?

109
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:36,406
-Probably.
-Really?

110
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:39,983
I'll tell you something.
Passion is way overrated.

111
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,676
-Yeah, right.
-lt is.

112
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:44,379
Eventually, it kind of burns out.

113
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:49,659
But hopefully what you're left
with is trust and security and....

114
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,887
In my ex-wife's case,
lesbianism.

115
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:01,696
For those people who miss out
on that passion thing...

116
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:03,375
...there's other stuff.

117
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:08,674
-Okay.
-But I don't think that'll be you.

118
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:13,173
-You don't?
-See, I see...

119
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,583
-... big passion in your future.
-Really?

120
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,855
-You do?
-I do.

121
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:22,256
Ross, you' re so great.

122
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:34,229
It's never gonna happen.

123
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,306
-What?
-You and Rachel.

124
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:51,389
What? Me and Ra?

125
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:53,751
Why not?

126
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:58,386
You waited too long
to make your move...

127
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,533
...and now you' re
in the "friend zone. "

128
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:06,898
-l' m not in the zone.
-No, Ross. You' re mayor of the zone.

129
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:13,144
Look, l' m taking my time, all right?
I' m laying the groundwork.

130
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:16,213
Every day I get
a little bit closer to

131
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:17,575
Priesthood!

132
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:23,378
I'm telling you, she has
no idea what you're thinking.

133
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:26,990
She just ran her fingers
through my hair.

134
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:30,788
-Were you missing that interaction?
-No, no, no.

135
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:34,865
This is running fingers
through your hair, okay?

136
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:38,264
Now this is a tousle.

137
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:44,409
If you don't ask her out soon,
you'll be in the zone forever.

138
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:48,444
I will, I will.
I'm waiting for the right moment.

139
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:52,511
What?

140
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:55,679
-What, now?
-Yeah.

141
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:01,248
What's messing you up?
The wine? The moonlight?

142
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:05,162
You gotta go up to her and say,
" Look, Rachel, l"

143
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,029
-What?
-We' re shushing...

144
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:12,733
... because we' re trying
to hear something.

145
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:16,704
-What? What?
-Don't you hear that?

146
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:23,072
See?

147
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:30,555
-Would you like gum?
-ls it sugarless?

148
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:35,654
-Sorry, it's not.
-Then no, thanks.

149
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:36,850
What was that?

150
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:43,392
Mental note: If Jill Goodacre
offers you gum, you take it.

151
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:48,062
If she offers you mangled
animal carcass, you take it!

152
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:53,241
New York City has no power

153
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:57,075
And the milk is getting sour

154
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,647
But to me it is not scary

155
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:05,051
Because I stay away from dairy

156
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,792
-Here goes.
-You'll do it?

157
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,366
-I'll do it.
-Want help?

158
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,731
You come out, you' re a dead man.

159
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:25,338
-Good luck, man.
-Thanks.

160
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:31,748
-Okay.
-Okay.

161
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:38,345
Where you going?
You can't go out there.

162
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:42,425
-Why not?
-Because of the reason.

163
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:47,293
-That would be?
-I can't tell you.

164
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,627
Joey, what's going on?

165
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:54,397
You gotta promise you'll
never tell Ross that I told you.

166
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,440
-What?
-He's planning your birthday party.

167
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:02,773
-Oh, my God! I love him!
-You better act surprised.

168
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:05,314
-About what?
-My surprise party.

169
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:09,511
-What surprise party?
-Oh, stop it. Joey already told me.

170
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:11,680
He didn't tell me.

171
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,226
Don't look at me. This is Ross' thing.

172
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:18,794
This is typical.
I'm always the last to know.

173
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:20,966
You are not. We tell you stuff.

174
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:26,434
I was the last one to know when
Chandler got bit by the peacock.

175
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:30,536
I was the last to know
you had a crush on Joey.

176
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:31,801
What?

177
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:35,307
Looks like I was second to last.

178
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,078
You had a crush on me?

179
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:47,587
All right. It wasn't a crush,
it was a dent.

180
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,227
Big dent?

181
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:55,628
You were moving your furniture.
I thought you had nice arms.

182
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:59,767
Nice arms, huh?

183
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,467
Hey, Mon, l' m moving the chair.

184
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:07,008
Do anything for you?

185
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:13,613
With all the lights out
you can actually see the stars.

186
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:15,582
It's so nice.

187
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,888
I have a question.

188
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:26,462
Actually, it's not
so much a question.

189
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:29,190
It's more
of a general wondering....

190
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:31,262
ment.

191
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:35,970
-Okay.
-Okay. Here it goes.

192
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:42,440
Well, for a while now,
I've been wanting to....

193
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:47,985
-Yes, that's right.
-Look at that little kitty!

194
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:49,949
What?

195
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:56,324
Top of the world
Looking down on creation

196
00:14:56,528 --> 00:15:00,692
And the only explanation I can find

197
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:08,395
Is the love that I found
Ever since you 've been around

198
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:25,657
All right, this is just Bactine.
It won't hurt.

199
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,926
-Ow!
-Sorry, that was wax.

200
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:36,599
Poor little T ooty's scared.
We should find his owner.

201
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:39,202
Why not put poor T ooty in the hall?

202
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:43,036
During a blackout?
She'll get trampled.

203
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:44,641
Yeah?

204
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:50,204
Damage control. Get back to the gum.

205
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,350
Gum would be perfection.

206
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:56,579
Gum would be perfection?

207
00:15:57,089 --> 00:15:59,216
Gum would be perfection.

208
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:03,122
Could've said,
"Gum would be nice. " But, no.

209
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:07,060
For me, gum is perfection.

210
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:10,796
I loathe myself!

211
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:16,337
Oh, no, they' re nuns.
They hate all living things.

212
00:16:22,247 --> 00:16:26,650
Hi. We just found this cat,
and we' re looking for the owner.

213
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:29,252
Yeah, it's mine.

214
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:35,285
-He seems to hate you. Are you sure?
-It's my cat. Give me my cat.

215
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:39,892
-Wait a minute. What's his name?
-Bob Buttons.

216
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:44,895
-Bob Buttons?
-Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons.

217
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,137
You are a very bad man!

218
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:52,536
You owe me a cat.

219
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:59,176
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

220
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,182
Here, kitty, kitty.

221
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,514
Where did you go, little kitty?

222
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:08,827
IKitty, kitty, kitty.
Come here, kitty, kitty.

223
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:16,499
-Hi.
-Buona sera.

224
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:18,300
Wow!

225
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,701
Mon, wanna go for a ride
in my racecar?

226
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:28,846
I'll bring my arms.

227
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:33,073
We can bring my wheelbarrow
for your teeth!

228
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,779
Come on, lucky sixes!

229
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:41,218
Everybody, this is Paolo.

230
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:46,159
Paolo, I want you to meet my friends.
This is Monica...

231
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,196
-Hi.
-...and Joey...

232
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,335
-Hi.
-...and Ross.

233
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:52,834
Hi.

234
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:01,639
He doesn't speak much English.

235
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,778
Monopoly!

236
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:07,952
Look at that!

237
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:12,646
So, where did Paolo come from?

238
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:15,521
Italy, I think.

239
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:19,390
No, I mean tonight.
Suddenly, into our lives.

240
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:24,832
That cat turned out to be Paolo's cat.
Isn't that funny?

241
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:30,000
That is funny.
And Rachel keeps touching him.

242
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:36,805
I looked all over and couldn't find
the kitty anywhere.

243
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:39,449
I found him. It was Paolo's cat.

244
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:43,183
Well, there you go.
Last to know again.

245
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:47,657
And I'm guessing, this is Paolo?

246
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,193
Paolo, this is Phoebe.

247
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,295
You betcha!

248
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:04,175
All right. Okay. What next?

249
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:07,643
Blow a bubble. A bubble's good.

250
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:10,679
It's got a boyish charm. It's impish.

251
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:12,282
Here we go.

252
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,324
Nice going, imp!

253
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:28,531
It's okay. All I need to do...

254
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:33,330
...is reach over and put it
back in my mouth.

255
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:38,934
Good save!
We 're back on track and I'm...

256
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:42,238
... chewing someone else 's gum.

257
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:46,978
This is not my gum!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

258
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:49,616
And now you 're choking.

259
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:52,913
You all right?

260
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,961
My God! You' re choking!

261
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:04,936
-Better?
-Yes.

262
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:06,764
Thank you. That was....

263
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:10,134
-That was....
-Perfection?

264
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,854
That was no tousle.

265
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:43,640
-What'd he say that was so funny?
-I have absolutely no idea.

266
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:45,742
That's classic.

267
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:50,005
My God, you guys! What am I doing?
This is so un-me!

268
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:52,376
If you want, I'll do it.

269
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:56,715
I just wanna bite his bottom lip.

270
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,123
But I won't.

271
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:02,758
The first time he smiled at me...

272
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:06,863
...those seconds were more exciting
than weeks with Barry.

273
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:08,464
Did you rent mopeds?

274
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:15,005
Because I've heard
Oh, it's not about that right now.

275
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:19,208
I know it's superficial,
and we have nothing in common...

276
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:23,677
...and we don't even speak
the same language, but, God!

277
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:31,115
-Paolo, hi.
-Ross.

278
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:32,312
Listen....

279
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:39,424
Listen, something you should know.

280
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:42,897
Rachel and I are....

281
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:45,893
We' re kind of a thing.

282
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,001
-Thing?
-Thing. Yes, thing.

283
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:52,640
-You have the sex?
-No.

284
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:58,573
No, technically the sex
is not being had. But that's....

285
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,752
But that's not the point.

286
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:06,583
The point is that
Rachel and I should be....

287
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:10,018
Well, Rachel and l
should be together.

288
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:12,219
And if you get in the

289
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:14,262
-ln bed
-No.

290
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:17,695
No, not where I was going.

291
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:22,272
If you get in the way of us
becoming a thing...

292
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:26,069
...then I would be, well, very sad.

293
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,308
So, do you...?

294
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:39,213
-So you do know a little English?
-Little.

295
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:42,882
-Do you know the word "crap-weasel "?
-No.

296
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,626
That's funny.
You are a huge crap-weasel.

297
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:55,604
We've been doing this
for an hour. It's easy.

298
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:57,172
Ready?

299
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,604
Okay? Now try it.

300
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:06,180
You gotta whip it.

301
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:14,854
Look, look. The last candle's
about to burn out.

302
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:19,360
T en, nine, eight, seven...

303
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:24,365
... minus 46, minus 47,
minus 48....

304
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:27,004
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

305
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:31,503
IKind of spooky without any lights.

306
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:41,413
Okay, guys, I have the definitive one.

307
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:57,858
This probably isn't the best time
to bring it up...

308
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:00,833
...but you have to throw
a party for Monica.

309
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,641
-This has been fun.
-Yes.

310
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:13,977
Thanks for letting me
use your phone...

311
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,614
...and for saving my life.

312
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,817
Well, goodbye, Chandler.
I had a great blackout.

313
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:24,188
See you.

314
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:43,537
