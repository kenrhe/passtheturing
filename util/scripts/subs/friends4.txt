All right, Phoebe?

2
00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:09,001
If I were omnipotent for a day,
I would want world peace...

3
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:12,144
...no hunger, good things
for the rain forest.

4
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,510
And bigger boobs.

5
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,814
Well, see, you took mine.

6
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:20,744
What about you?

7
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:25,891
If I were omnipotent for a day,
I'd make myself omnipotent forever.

8
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:31,223
There's always one guy. "lf I had a
wish, I'd wish for three more wishes. "

9
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:34,433
Hey, Joey.

10
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:37,467
What would you do
if you were omnipotent?

11
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,763
Probably kill myself.

12
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:42,134
Excuse me?

13
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:46,039
If little Joey's dead,
then I got no reason to live.

14
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:51,472
Joey, omnipotent.

15
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:53,953
You are?

16
00:00:54,287 --> 00:01:00,089
Ross, l' m sorry. I had no idea. I
thought it was a theoretical question.

17
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,291
The One With the George Stephanopoulos

18
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:52,043
How does she do that?

19
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:54,679
I can't sleep in a public place.

20
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:57,543
Libraries, airplanes,
movie theaters....

21
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,741
You slept at the Grand Canyon.

22
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:03,912
Hello, Mom and Dad never took us
to the Grand Canyon.

23
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:07,519
Mom and Dad took us
to the Grand Canyon?

24
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:12,028
Would you look at her?
She is so peaceful.

25
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:13,527
Yeah.

26
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:16,167
What? What? What?

27
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:20,499
-Hi.
-It's okay. You just nodded off again.

28
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:21,799
What's going on?

29
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:26,911
I got no sleep last night. My
grandmother has a new boyfriend...

30
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,649
...and they' re both kind of insecure
in bed, so And deaf.

31
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:38,184
They reassure each other
that they' re having a good time.

32
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:41,827
You have no idea how loud they are.

33
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:46,028
-You can stay with Rachel and me.
-Thanks.

34
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:49,395
95, 96, 97. See, I told you.

35
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:52,594
Less than 1 00 steps
from our place to here.

36
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:55,899
You got way too much free time, man.

37
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:58,703
There's the birthday boy.

38
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:03,508
Hockey tickets. Rangers-Penguins
tonight and we're taking you.

39
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:06,844
-Happy birthday, pal!
-We love you, man.

40
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:11,285
It's funny. My birthday
was seven months ago.

41
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:14,119
-So?
-So you had an extra ticket...

42
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:17,626
...and couldn't decide
who got to bring a date?

43
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,493
Well, aren't we
Mr. The-Glass-ls-Half-Empty?

44
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:25,670
Oh, my God! Is today the 20th?
October 20th?

45
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:29,968
-I hoped you wouldn't remember.
-What's wrong with the 20th?

46
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:34,738
Eleven days before Halloween.
All the good costumes are gone?

47
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:38,611
T oday's the day Carol and I first...

48
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:41,048
...consummated our...

49
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,814
... physical relationship.

50
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,422
Sex.

51
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:53,692
-You told your sister that?
-Believe me, I told everyone.

52
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,163
I better pass on the game.

53
00:03:56,369 --> 00:04:01,534
I'm just gonna go home and think about
my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.

54
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:05,343
The hell with hockey!
Let's all do that!

55
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:10,746
Come on, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice!
Guys' night out!

56
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,418
Come on, what do you say, big guy?

57
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,180
-What are you doing?
-I have no idea.

58
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:20,756
-Come on, Ross.
-Maybe it will take my mind off it.

59
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,123
-Promise to buy me a big foam finger?
-You got it.

60
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:27,227
Look, look, look! My first paycheck!

61
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:32,029
Look at the window!
There's my name! Hi, me!

62
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:35,207
I remember when
I got my first paycheck.

63
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:39,572
There was a cave-in in a mine,
and eight people were killed.

64
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:45,682
-You worked in a mine?
-No, I worked at a Dairy Queen. Why?

65
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:54,049
Isn't this exciting? I earned this.
I wiped tables for it. I steamed milk.

66
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,455
And it was totally...

67
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:58,858
... not worth it.

68
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:03,024
What's FlCA?
Why's he getting all my money?

69
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:07,261
I mean, what?
Chandler, look at that.

70
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,038
This is not that bad.

71
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:13,041
You're fine, yeah, for a first job.

72
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,908
You can totally,
totally live on this.

73
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:18,447
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

74
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:22,610
-By the way, great service today.
-Yeah.

75
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:28,652
-Hockey!
-Hockey!

76
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:41,771
-Hockey!
-Hockey.

77
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:45,501
Rachel?

78
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:48,846
Oh, my God!

79
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:57,851
I swear I've seen birds
do this on Wild Kingdom.

80
00:05:58,057 --> 00:05:59,718
What are you doing here?

81
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:05,728
We were in the city shopping, and your
mom said you work here, and it's true!

82
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:12,160
Look at you in the apron.
You look like you're in a play.

83
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:17,531
God, look at you! You're so big!
I can't believe it!

84
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:21,373
I know, I know! I'm a duplex.

85
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:27,313
IKiki, you look phenomenal. I mean,
you've lost, like, a ton of weight.

86
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,385
And you should...

87
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:33,815
... really, really It's time to stop,
you look perfect.

88
00:06:34,026 --> 00:06:35,550
What's going on?

89
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:39,823
Well, guess who my dad's
making partner in his firm?

90
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:45,827
And while we're on
the subject of news....

91
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:51,603
Look, look! I have elbows!

92
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:59,274
Passes it up to Leetch.

93
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:02,750
Leetch spots Messier. Here's the pass!

94
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:08,393
We'll take a time-out while Messier
looks at some women's shoes.

95
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:13,531
Carol was wearing boots just like
those the night that we first....

96
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,861
You know? In fact, she....

97
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:19,230
She never took them off.

98
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,704
It's because we Sorry, sorry.

99
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:26,476
I can't believe

100
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,506
-What?
-Peach pit.

101
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,041
Yes, bunny?

102
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:36,045
Peach pit. That night, we had

103
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:40,282
-Peaches?
-Actually, nectarines but....

104
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:41,983
Could've been a peach.

105
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:47,827
Then we Then we got dressed
and I walked her to...

106
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:51,868
...the bus stop. I' m fine.

107
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:55,866
Hey, that woman's got
an ass like Carol's.

108
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,940
What? I thought we were
trying to find stuff.

109
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,512
Come on, you guys.
T ell me all the dirt.

110
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:11,782
Well, the biggest news is still you
dumping Barry at the altar.

111
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:16,658
-Let's talk reality for a second.
-Okay.

112
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:21,061
-When are you coming home?
-What? Guys, l' m not.

113
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:24,964
-Come on. This is us.
-l' m not.

114
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:29,232
This is what l' m doing now.
I've got this job.

115
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:32,570
I even do my own laundry.

116
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:39,983
-This is what l' m doing now.
-Waitressing?

117
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:46,147
I' m not just waitressing.
I mean, l' m....

118
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:52,264
I write the specials
on the specials board.

119
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:56,561
And I take the dead flowers
out of the vase.

120
00:08:56,769 --> 00:09:01,638
Sometimes Arturo lets me put the
chocolate blobbies on the cookies.

121
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:05,971
Well, your mom didn't tell us
about the blobbies.

122
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:19,048
Hey, Rach.
How was it with your friends?

123
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:25,594
Okay, how would you like
some Tiki Death punch?

124
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:28,289
-What's that?
-Well, it's rum and

125
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,264
Okay.

126
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:35,735
Since Phoebe's staying,
we'll have a slumber party.

127
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:40,208
We got trashy magazines.
We got cookie dough. We got Twister.

128
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:46,612
And I brought Operation. But I lost
the tweezers so we can't operate.

129
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:49,854
But we can prep the guy.

130
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:56,290
-Rach, it's the Visa card people.
-Oh, God. Ask them what they want.

131
00:09:56,495 --> 00:10:00,124
Could you please tell me
what this is in reference to?

132
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,427
There's been unusual
activity on your account.

133
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,969
I haven't used my card in weeks.

134
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,801
That is the unusual activity.

135
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,377
They wanna see if you're okay.

136
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:17,606
They wanna know if I'm okay?
Okay, let's see.

137
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:21,651
Well, let's see.
The FlCA guys took all my money.

138
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:25,449
Everyone is getting married
or pregnant or promoted.

139
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:29,754
And I'm getting coffee.
And it's not even for me!

140
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:34,331
If that sounds like I'm okay,
then tell them I'm okay. Okay?

141
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:41,438
Rachel has left the building.
Can you call back?

142
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,303
All right! Come on!

143
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:47,372
Let's play Twister!

144
00:10:55,521 --> 00:11:00,424
-Sorry.
-Sorry. Sorry, sorry.

145
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:04,426
There was ice that night with Carol?
Plastic seats?

146
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,622
Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?

147
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:12,063
No, I was just saying
we're not sitting together.

148
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:16,071
But now that you mention it,
there was ice that night.

149
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:19,443
It was the first frost.

150
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:21,977
Sit. Just sit down. Sit.

151
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,776
You're doing
this amazing independent thing.

152
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:28,283
Monica, what is so amazing?

153
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:32,685
I gave up, like, everything.
And for what?

154
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:36,419
-You are just like Jack.
-Jack from downstairs?

155
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:40,088
No, Jack and the Beanstalk.

156
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:42,158
Ah, the other Jack.

157
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:46,805
Right. He gave up something
but then he got those magic beans.

158
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:51,375
And then he woke up
and there was this big plant...

159
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:55,069
...outside of his window,
full of possibilities.

160
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:58,717
He lived in a village,
and you live in the Village.

161
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:05,323
Okay. But, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow.
I gave up an orthodontist.

162
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:10,689
-Okay, I know I didn't love him....
-Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.

163
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:14,257
But, see, it was a plan. It was clear.

164
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:17,402
Everything was figured out.
Now it's like....

165
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:19,662
-Floopy?
-Yeah.

166
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:24,170
We don't know where we' re going.

167
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:29,780
It's all gonna come together
and it's just gonna be un-floopy.

168
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:32,314
Yeah, like that's a word.

169
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:39,348
Okay. But Monica, what if
it doesn't come together?

170
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,155
Pheebs?

171
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:46,964
Well, because you just
I don't like this question.

172
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,297
See, you guys?
What if we don't get magic beans?

173
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:56,203
I mean, what if all
we've got are beans?

174
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,945
Get him! Get him! Get him!

175
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:06,084
Yes! You're not laughing now,
are you, pal?

176
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:10,244
All you needed were guys
hitting each other with sticks.

177
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,822
Pass it! Pass it!

178
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:17,587
-He's open! He's open!
-Shoot it! Shoot it!

179
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:25,296
Hey, look, we're on that TV thing.

180
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:37,842
Excuse me?

181
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:42,316
It says to call if you're not
satisfied with this candy bar.

182
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:45,649
Well, I'm not completely satisfied.

183
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,519
Well, the label
promises nutty goodness.

184
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:56,223
It's an emergency. But you know that,
or we'd be in the predicament room.

185
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:01,635
Hold on. Fill these out.
Sit over there!

186
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:06,003
I don't want to make any trouble
but I'm in a lot of pain.

187
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:10,512
-My face is dented.
-Well, you'll have to wait your turn.

188
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:15,813
-How long do you think it will be?
-Any minute now.

189
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,016
Hey, this

190
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:36,305
I' m so sorry, you guys.
I didn't mean to bring you down.

191
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:41,912
No, you were right.
I don't have a plan.

192
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:47,382
-Pizza guy.
-Food!

193
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:49,679
-Phoebe?
-What?

194
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:54,121
-Do you have a plan?
-I don't even have a " pla. "

195
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,156
One mushroom, green pepper and onion?

196
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:03,165
No, no, no.
That's not what we ordered!

197
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:07,305
We ordered a fat-free crust
with extra cheese!

198
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:14,502
Wait. You' re not G. Stephanopoulos?
Man, my dad's gonna kill me!

199
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:18,911
Wait! Did you say G. Stephanopoulos?

200
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:24,181
Yeah, this one goes across the street.
I gave him yours. Bonehead! Bonehead!

201
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:28,121
When you do that,
you're only hitting yourself.

202
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:36,065
Was this a small Mediterranean guy
with curiously intelligent good looks?

203
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:40,295
-That sounds right.
-Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?

204
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:44,340
-And a power tie?
-No, pretty much just a towel.

205
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:48,639
-Oh, God!
-You guys want me to take this back?

206
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:53,614
What, are you nuts? We've got
George Stephanopoulos' pizza!

207
00:15:57,222 --> 00:16:01,818
Pheebs, who's George Snuffleupagus?

208
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:06,122
That's Big Bird's friend.

209
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:11,300
-I see pizza!
-I want to see. Let me see.

210
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:13,494
Hello! Who are we spying on?

211
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:16,869
White House adviser,
Clinton's campaign guy.

212
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:20,477
The one with the great hair,
sexy smile, cute butt.

213
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:24,740
Oh, him! The little guy.
Oh, I love him!

214
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:30,411
-Wait. Wait, I see a woman.
-T ell me it's his mother.

215
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:33,284
-Definitely not his mother.
-Oh, no!

216
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:38,156
Wait, she's walking across the floor.
She's walking, she's walking....

217
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:42,095
She's going for the pizza
That's not for you, bitch!

218
00:16:57,082 --> 00:17:02,076
We've been here for over an hour,
and people less sick have gone in.

219
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:05,916
That guy with the toe thing,
who's he sleeping with?

220
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,595
Oh, come on, Dora. Don't be mad.

221
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:14,595
I know we both said some things...

222
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:20,267
...we didn't mean but that doesn't
mean we still don't love each other.

223
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:24,067
You know, I feel like I've lost her.

224
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,604
-Come on, push me.
-No.

225
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:32,409
-Push me.
-We' re gonna get in trouble.

226
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:35,018
Don't be a baby. Push me. Push me.

227
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:40,590
All right. I' m gonna push you, okay?
How about I push you like this?

228
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:48,196
Now you're gonna be in a wheelchair
the rest of your life, pally-wally....

229
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:55,530
I am so very sorry. Can I sign you?

230
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,001
-Lights still out?
-Yeah.

231
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:03,010
Well, maybe they' re napping.

232
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:07,777
-Please. They' re having sex.
-Shut up!

233
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:15,252
So, what do you think George is like?

234
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:17,793
-I think he's shy.
-Yeah.

235
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:20,863
Yeah. I think you have
to draw him out.

236
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:26,094
And then when you do,
he's a preppy animal.

237
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,031
-What do you think of the guys?
-Our guys?

238
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:33,643
-Yeah, our guys.
-I feel funny talking about that.

239
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:37,111
-Oh, come on.
-Okay. Well....

240
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:40,046
I think Joey's like
a little kiddie ride.

241
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:44,552
You just have to put the quarter in
and it just goes.

242
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:49,988
He might surprise you. One time,
he helped me put on my coat...

243
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:52,993
...and he was really tender.

244
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:57,726
Come on, baby, come on. Let's go.

245
00:18:57,936 --> 00:18:59,836
Yes!

246
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:05,570
Chandler's one of those repressed guys
who you'd have to seduce.

247
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:10,680
I think it's an act. Chandler is
more sophisticated than he seems.

248
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:18,615
-You know who's kind of sexy?
-Don't.

249
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:22,282
-Ross.
-No, guys. Please, he is my brother.

250
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:26,157
I know exactly what you mean.
He can be really smooth.

251
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:40,105
Can't you just picture him in bed?

252
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:42,576
I really don't want to.

253
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:45,880
Come on, laugh. Laugh.

254
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:51,381
I remember the moonlight coming in the
window, and her face had the most...

255
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,251
...incredible glow.

256
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:57,417
The moon, the glow,
the magical feeling. You did this.

257
00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:00,962
Could I get some painkillers
over here, please?

258
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:05,199
He's right. Enough.
What's the big deal about today?

259
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:08,202
So you slept with her
for the first time.

260
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:11,501
You slept with her
for seven years after that.

261
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:14,578
It's a little more complicated

262
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:19,547
What is it, that she left you
for another woman that likes women?

263
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:25,314
Louder. There's a man on the 1 2th
floor in a coma who didn't hear you.

264
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:28,887
Then, what?

265
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:32,691
My first time with Carol was...

266
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,492
...was my....

267
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:37,529
What?

268
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:45,032
It was my first time.

269
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,478
With Carol?

270
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:53,481
Oh.

271
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:57,847
So, in your whole life,
you've only been with one?

272
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:03,317
Oh, boy. Hockey was a big mistake.

273
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:07,220
There's a bunch of stuff
we could've done tonight.

274
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:11,028
Okay, I got one.

275
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,564
Do you remember
that vegetarian pate...

276
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,799
...that I made that you loved so much?

277
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:22,613
Well, unless goose is a vegetable!

278
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:29,715
Now I don't feel so bad
about sleeping with Jason Hurley.

279
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:33,880
-What? You slept with Jason?
-You had already broken up.

280
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:36,560
-How long?
-Just a couple hours.

281
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:41,461
-Oh, that's nice!
-Okay, okay, okay, I got one!

282
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:48,372
Anyway, the valentine T om left in
your locker was really from me!

283
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,972
Excuse me?

284
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:55,636
Hello! Like he was really
gonna send you one.

285
00:21:56,848 --> 00:22:00,147
She was a big girl!

286
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:07,016
Really? Well, at least big girls don't
pee in their pants in seventh grade!

287
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:10,123
I was laughing. You made me laugh!

288
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,889
Oh, my God! There he is! There he is!

289
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:16,431
-Where?
-Where we've been looking all night.

290
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:19,862
-He's so cute.
-George, baby, drop the towel.

291
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:24,441
-Come on, drop the towel.
-Drop it. Will you please drop it?

292
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,803
Wow!

293
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:34,745
Man, can you believe
he's only had sex with one woman?

294
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:39,550
I think it's great.
You know, it's sweet.

295
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:41,817
It's romantic.

296
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:43,688
Really?

297
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:47,126
You kidding? The guy's a freak.
I judge him.

298
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:49,232
-Hey, man!
-Hey, buddy!

299
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:57,099
Oh, that's attractive.

300
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:01,871
I thought you were great
in Silence of the Lambs.

301
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:07,310
Admit it, all things considered,
you had fun tonight.

302
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:11,114
Fun? Where was the fun?
T ell me which part was fun.

303
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:12,722
Where's my puck?

304
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:15,893
-The kid has it.
-The kid

305
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:19,626
Excuse me, that's my puck.

306
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:24,268
I found it.
Finders keepers, losers weepers.

307
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:28,830
You gotta do it, man.

308
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:32,744
I' m rubber, you' re glue.
Whatever you

309
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:34,741
I can't do it.

310
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:37,709
-Listen, give me back my puck.
-No.

311
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,543
-Yes, how about?
-No.

312
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,548
-Give me my puck.
-No.

313
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,687
No roughhousing in my ER!

314
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:46,380
Give me my puck!

315
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:53,694
Now that was fun.

316
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:03,541
Okay, Monica. Right foot, red.

317
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:07,576
We could've played Monopoly, but no!

318
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:15,181
Thanks.

319
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:25,195
Okay, Pheebs. Right hand, blue.

320
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:36,130
Ross, switch with me
and Phoebe could be number two.

321
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:42,543
Nothing. It's a Twister thing.
The rules are on the back of the box.

322
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:46,912
Hello?

323
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:49,018
It's the Visa card people.

324
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:53,214
-Okay. Will you take my place?
-All right. This is Rachel.

325
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:55,120
No!

326
00:24:57,229 --> 00:25:02,633
Hello? Oh, yeah. No, I know.
I haven't been using it much.

327
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:06,099
Oh, well, thanks.
But l' m okay, really.

328
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,670
-To the green.
-Oh, no.

329
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:11,707
I've got magic beans.

330
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:15,474
No, no, never mind.

331
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,410
T o the left! T o the left!

332
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:21,780
