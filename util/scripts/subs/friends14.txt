1
00:00:03,416 --> 00:00:05,372
I'm teIIing you, she wants you.

2
00:00:05,616 --> 00:00:08,255
She bareIy knows me.
We just Iive in the same buiIding.

3
00:00:08,496 --> 00:00:09,292
Any contact?

4
00:00:09,496 --> 00:00:10,724
She lent me an egg once.

5
00:00:10,936 --> 00:00:12,085
You're in!

6
00:00:13,136 --> 00:00:14,615
Oh, right.

7
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:24,976
Come on. You gotta get back
in the game here.

8
00:00:25,216 --> 00:00:29,175
The Rachel thing's not happening,
your ex-wife's a lesbian, you. . . .

9
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:31,893
I don't think we need a third.

10
00:00:32,136 --> 00:00:35,208
Excuse me. Could we get an egg
still in the shell?

11
00:00:35,616 --> 00:00:36,412
An egg?

12
00:00:36,656 --> 00:00:41,332
Go up to her and say, ''Here's your
egg back. I'm returning your egg. ''

13
00:00:41,896 --> 00:00:43,454
I think it's winning!

14
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:45,371
I think it's insane.

15
00:00:45,616 --> 00:00:46,412
She'll love it!

16
00:00:47,816 --> 00:00:50,410
-Thank you.
-Thank you. Here.

17
00:00:53,496 --> 00:00:55,293
Go with the egg, my friend.

18
00:00:57,616 --> 00:00:59,891
Go, go, go!

19
00:01:01,816 --> 00:01:04,933
-Think it'll work?
-It's suicide. The man's got an egg.

20
00:01:05,496 --> 00:01:07,532
The One With the Candy Hearts

21
00:01:08,776 --> 00:01:09,765
English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

22
00:01:53,616 --> 00:01:55,607
-You cannot do this.
-What? Do what?

23
00:01:55,856 --> 00:01:57,335
Roger wants to take her out.

24
00:01:57,536 --> 00:02:00,448
No! Pheebs! Don't you remember
why you dumped the guy?

25
00:02:01,096 --> 00:02:02,529
Because he was creepy.

26
00:02:03,496 --> 00:02:05,327
And mean. And a little frightening.

27
00:02:05,576 --> 00:02:08,010
Still, it's nice to have
a date on Valentine's Day!

28
00:02:10,376 --> 00:02:12,890
You can go out with a creep
any night of the year.

29
00:02:13,536 --> 00:02:14,764
I know I do.

30
00:02:18,176 --> 00:02:19,734
What are you doing tomorrow night?

31
00:02:19,936 --> 00:02:22,734
Actually, tomorrow night
depends on how tonight goes.

32
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:26,366
-Listen, about tonight--
-Don't you dare bail on me!

33
00:02:26,616 --> 00:02:29,926
She's only going out with me because
I'm bringing a friend for her friend.

34
00:02:30,136 --> 00:02:31,933
But her friend sounds like such a--

35
00:02:32,176 --> 00:02:34,292
Pathetic mess. I know, but. . . .

36
00:02:34,816 --> 00:02:37,330
Come on, man, she's needy,
she's vulnerable.

37
00:02:37,536 --> 00:02:39,128
I'm thinking. . . .

38
00:02:43,816 --> 00:02:44,646
Thanks.

39
00:02:45,616 --> 00:02:49,211
You haven't been out with a woman
since Janice. You're doing this.

40
00:02:52,176 --> 00:02:53,325
She said yes.

41
00:02:54,016 --> 00:02:55,654
Way to go, man!

42
00:02:57,016 --> 00:02:58,927
Still got the egg, huh?

43
00:03:11,896 --> 00:03:12,885
How do I look?

44
00:03:14,216 --> 00:03:15,535
I don't care.

45
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:20,451
There's Lorraine.

46
00:03:20,696 --> 00:03:22,368
Now, remember, no trading.

47
00:03:22,616 --> 00:03:24,811
You get the pretty one.
I get the mess.

48
00:03:29,616 --> 00:03:31,095
Well, well!

49
00:03:31,296 --> 00:03:32,854
Look what you brought!

50
00:03:33,096 --> 00:03:34,495
Very nice.

51
00:03:35,536 --> 00:03:37,367
And what did you bring?

52
00:03:39,016 --> 00:03:40,654
She's checking her coat.

53
00:03:40,896 --> 00:03:44,047
I'm gonna go wash the cab smell
off of my hands.

54
00:03:44,296 --> 00:03:47,925
Will you get me a white zinfandel
and a glass of red for Janice?

55
00:03:52,616 --> 00:03:53,446
Janice?

56
00:03:58,016 --> 00:03:59,165
Oh. . .

57
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:00,565
. . .my. . .

58
00:04:00,816 --> 00:04:01,965
. . .God!

59
00:04:05,816 --> 00:04:07,408
Hey, it's Janice!

60
00:04:13,816 --> 00:04:16,250
I'm making a break for it!
I'm going out the window!

61
00:04:16,496 --> 00:04:20,933
No, don't, please! I've been waiting
for forever to go out with Lorraine!

62
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,252
-Just calm down.
-Calm down? Calm down?

63
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:27,330
You set me up with a woman I've dumped
twice in the last five months!

64
00:04:28,576 --> 00:04:31,966
Can you stop yelling?
You're making me nervous. . .

65
00:04:35,216 --> 00:04:37,332
. . .and I can't go when I'm nervous.

66
00:04:37,896 --> 00:04:39,932
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right.

67
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,733
Come on! Do it, do it, do it!
Come on!

68
00:04:48,376 --> 00:04:51,925
Okay, Roger was creepy, but he was
nothing compared to Pete Carney.

69
00:04:52,176 --> 00:04:53,973
-Which one was he?
-Pete the Weeper?

70
00:04:54,216 --> 00:04:57,731
Remember the guy that used to cry
every time we had sex?

71
00:04:58,216 --> 00:05:00,605
''Oh, was it good for you?''

72
00:05:02,656 --> 00:05:06,729
Well, I'd take a little crying
any day over Howard, the ''I win'' guy!

73
00:05:06,936 --> 00:05:08,927
''I win! I win! ''

74
00:05:10,296 --> 00:05:13,527
I went out with him for
two months. I didn't get to win once!

75
00:05:14,136 --> 00:05:17,367
How do we end up with these jerks?
We're good people.

76
00:05:17,616 --> 00:05:20,335
I don't know. I think we're like
some kind of magnets.

77
00:05:20,576 --> 00:05:23,932
I know I am. That's why I can't
wear a digital watch.

78
00:05:26,816 --> 00:05:28,613
There's more beer, right?

79
00:05:30,616 --> 00:05:33,653
Oh! You know my friend Abby
who shaves her head?

80
00:05:35,176 --> 00:05:37,770
She says to break the
bad-boyfriend cycle. . .

81
00:05:38,016 --> 00:05:40,211
. . .you can do a cleansing ritual.

82
00:05:42,816 --> 00:05:46,286
Pheebs, this woman
is voluntarily bald.

83
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:52,130
So we can do it
tomorrow night, you guys.

84
00:05:52,376 --> 00:05:54,128
It's Valentine's Day.
It's perfect.

85
00:05:54,616 --> 00:05:56,652
Okay, well, what kind of ritual?

86
00:05:56,896 --> 00:06:00,775
Okay, we can burn the stuff
they gave us.

87
00:06:01,816 --> 00:06:03,215
Or. . .?

88
00:06:03,456 --> 00:06:08,052
Or we can chant and dance
around naked, you know, with sticks.

89
00:06:11,136 --> 00:06:12,205
Burning's good.

90
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:13,935
I've got stuff to burn.

91
00:06:22,136 --> 00:06:23,012
You know. . .

92
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:28,048
. . .ever since I was little, I've been
able to pick up quarters with my toes.

93
00:06:28,296 --> 00:06:29,206
Yeah?

94
00:06:29,616 --> 00:06:30,810
Good for you.

95
00:06:33,776 --> 00:06:36,609
Quarters or rolls of quarters?

96
00:06:41,896 --> 00:06:45,525
By the way, Chandler,
I cut you out of all of my pictures.

97
00:06:45,776 --> 00:06:49,086
So if you want, I have a bag
with just your heads.

98
00:06:50,776 --> 00:06:52,004
That's okay.

99
00:06:52,776 --> 00:06:56,246
Are you sure? Because you
could make little puppets out of them.

100
00:06:56,496 --> 00:06:59,852
And you could use them in your
Theater of Cruelty!

101
00:07:02,536 --> 00:07:03,935
We can't do that!

102
00:07:05,016 --> 00:07:07,052
What? What can't you do?

103
00:07:10,176 --> 00:07:12,292
Can I talk to you for a second?
Over there?

104
00:07:19,616 --> 00:07:21,174
We might be leaving now.

105
00:07:22,296 --> 00:07:23,854
Say it's you and me ''we. ''

106
00:07:25,296 --> 00:07:29,130
She said she wants to slather my body
with stuff and then lick it off.

107
00:07:29,376 --> 00:07:31,936
I'm not even sure what slathering is!

108
00:07:32,496 --> 00:07:34,930
But I definitely want to be
a part of it!

109
00:07:36,336 --> 00:07:38,850
Okay, you cannot do this to me.

110
00:07:40,216 --> 00:07:42,411
You're right. I'm sorry.
You're right.

111
00:07:42,616 --> 00:07:46,734
Can we have three chocolate mousses
to go, please?

112
00:07:47,496 --> 00:07:48,815
I'm out of here.

113
00:07:50,696 --> 00:07:53,733
Here's my credit card.
Dinner's on me. I'm sorry.

114
00:07:54,296 --> 00:07:56,446
I hope she throws up on you.

115
00:07:58,816 --> 00:07:59,805
Thanks.

116
00:08:02,016 --> 00:08:02,846
So. . . .

117
00:08:03,296 --> 00:08:04,695
Just us.

118
00:08:05,096 --> 00:08:07,246
What a crappy night!

119
00:08:07,576 --> 00:08:11,535
Though I've enjoyed the fact that
your shirt's been sticking out. . .

120
00:08:11,776 --> 00:08:14,495
. . .of your zipper since you
came back from the bathroom.

121
00:08:19,536 --> 00:08:20,525
Excuse me.

122
00:08:23,896 --> 00:08:25,124
How you doing?

123
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,612
So do we have the best friends,
or what?

124
00:08:33,856 --> 00:08:36,086
Joey's not a friend. He's. . .

125
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:41,127
. . .a stupid man who left us
his credit card.

126
00:08:42,776 --> 00:08:46,052
Another drink? Some dessert?
A big-screen TV?

127
00:08:46,376 --> 00:08:47,809
I will go for that drink.

128
00:08:48,056 --> 00:08:49,535
You got it. Good woman!

129
00:08:54,776 --> 00:08:57,131
A bottle of your
most overpriced champagne.

130
00:08:57,336 --> 00:08:58,007
Each.

131
00:08:58,256 --> 00:08:59,530
That's right. Each.

132
00:08:59,736 --> 00:09:01,010
And a rob roy.

133
00:09:02,096 --> 00:09:03,734
I've always wanted to know.

134
00:09:21,216 --> 00:09:24,811
Happy Valentine's Day!

135
00:09:32,576 --> 00:09:35,295
Oh, I miss you already.

136
00:09:36,616 --> 00:09:38,254
Can you believe this happened?

137
00:09:38,496 --> 00:09:39,895
No, no!

138
00:09:41,216 --> 00:09:42,695
And yet it did.

139
00:09:43,576 --> 00:09:45,726
-Goodbye, Janice.
-Kiss me!

140
00:09:48,496 --> 00:09:49,770
Oh, Chandler. Sorry.

141
00:09:50,816 --> 00:09:53,171
Oh, Chandler. Sorry!

142
00:09:55,216 --> 00:09:56,171
Hey, Janice.

143
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:57,326
Hi, Monica.

144
00:09:57,536 --> 00:10:00,334
Okay. Well, this was very special.

145
00:10:01,496 --> 00:10:04,294
Rach, come see who's out here!

146
00:10:04,776 --> 00:10:07,529
What's going on--?
Oh, my God!

147
00:10:07,736 --> 00:10:09,806
Janice! Hi!

148
00:10:10,296 --> 00:10:12,856
Janice is gonna go away now!

149
00:10:14,696 --> 00:10:15,731
I'll be right back.

150
00:10:17,736 --> 00:10:19,772
Joey! Look who it is!

151
00:10:23,776 --> 00:10:25,255
Oh, good! Joey's home now!

152
00:10:25,496 --> 00:10:27,726
This is so much fun!

153
00:10:27,976 --> 00:10:30,854
This is like a reunion in the hall!

154
00:10:32,896 --> 00:10:35,854
Hi, Ross. There's someone
I want you to say hi to.

155
00:10:38,136 --> 00:10:39,410
He just happened to call.

156
00:10:39,656 --> 00:10:43,934
Hello, Ross. Yes, that's right!
It's me! How did you know?

157
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:53,365
I'm just saying if dogs
do experience jet lag, then. . .

158
00:10:53,616 --> 00:10:57,734
. . .because of the whole seven-dog-
years-to-one-human-year thing. . .

159
00:10:57,976 --> 00:11:01,127
. . .that when a dog flies
from New York to Los Angeles. . .

160
00:11:01,336 --> 00:11:05,329
. . .he doesn't just lose three hours,
he loses, like, a week and a half!

161
00:11:08,576 --> 00:11:09,691
That's funny!

162
00:11:26,776 --> 00:11:27,845
Who are they?

163
00:11:28,176 --> 00:11:30,246
The blond is my ex-wife.

164
00:11:30,496 --> 00:11:33,408
And the woman touching her is her. . .

165
00:11:33,816 --> 00:11:35,727
. . .close personal friend.

166
00:11:38,216 --> 00:11:39,854
You mean they're lovers?

167
00:11:40,096 --> 00:11:42,087
If you want to put a label on it.

168
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:48,214
-Anything else I should know?
-Nope. That's it.

169
00:11:49,696 --> 00:11:51,926
Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby.

170
00:11:55,736 --> 00:11:57,727
I always forget that part.

171
00:11:59,816 --> 00:12:00,805
Hello!

172
00:12:07,096 --> 00:12:11,806
Okay. So now we need sage branches
and the sacramental wine.

173
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,011
All I had is oregano and a Fresca.

174
00:12:17,016 --> 00:12:17,971
That's okay!

175
00:12:22,896 --> 00:12:26,047
All right. Now we need the semen
of a righteous man.

176
00:12:31,616 --> 00:12:35,848
If we had that, we wouldn't be doing
the ritual in the first place.

177
00:12:37,496 --> 00:12:39,327
Can we start throwing things in?

178
00:12:39,576 --> 00:12:40,804
Yeah, okay!

179
00:12:44,336 --> 00:12:45,849
Okay. Barry's letters.

180
00:12:47,216 --> 00:12:49,730
Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.

181
00:12:49,976 --> 00:12:53,855
And I have the receipt
from my dinner with--

182
00:12:57,816 --> 00:13:00,967
-A picture of Scotty Jared, naked!
-Let me see!

183
00:13:01,336 --> 00:13:03,008
He's wearing a sweater.

184
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:12,045
Okay, and here we have
the last of Paolo's grappa.

185
00:13:12,296 --> 00:13:13,695
Wait! Isn't it almost pure--

186
00:13:18,816 --> 00:13:21,455
How can I dump this woman
on Valentine's Day?

187
00:13:22,536 --> 00:13:24,527
I don't know.
You dumped her on New Year's.

188
00:13:26,616 --> 00:13:30,325
Oh, man! In my next life
I'm coming back as a toilet brush.

189
00:13:32,096 --> 00:13:34,485
Hello, funny valentine!

190
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:37,134
Hi, just Janice.

191
00:13:38,096 --> 00:13:40,451
Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker.

192
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:44,132
I could just kiss you all over
and I'm gonna!

193
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:50,814
If you don't do it, I will.

194
00:14:03,136 --> 00:14:06,208
So what do you do for a living?

195
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:09,010
Well, for the past few years,
I've been. . . .

196
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:11,776
You said they could
shoot the spot without you.

197
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:12,931
I thought they could!

198
00:14:13,176 --> 00:14:16,327
--working with children,
which is really fulfilling.

199
00:14:16,576 --> 00:14:19,648
I'll try to get back
as soon as I can. I'm sorry.

200
00:14:19,896 --> 00:14:23,047
So I'm spending most
of my time teaching science. . .

201
00:14:23,296 --> 00:14:26,891
. . .which is funny because
that wasn't even my major.

202
00:14:38,616 --> 00:14:40,334
Now, that is funny!

203
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:44,685
Hey, do you think--

204
00:14:45,096 --> 00:14:48,725
Would it be too weird if I invited
Carol over to join us?

205
00:14:48,976 --> 00:14:50,967
Because she's alone now.

206
00:14:51,496 --> 00:14:53,214
And pregnant. And sad.

207
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:55,735
-I guess.
-Are you sure?

208
00:14:55,976 --> 00:14:57,329
Thanks. Carol!

209
00:14:58,216 --> 00:14:59,729
Wanna come over and join us?

210
00:14:59,936 --> 00:15:01,130
Oh, no. I'm fine.

211
00:15:01,376 --> 00:15:04,334
Come on, stand up. These people
will scooch down.

212
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:07,608
Come over here.
You guys will scooch, won't you?

213
00:15:07,936 --> 00:15:10,734
Let's try scooching! Come on!

214
00:15:10,936 --> 00:15:12,972
-Come on.
-Thank you.

215
00:15:15,016 --> 00:15:17,974
Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willet.

216
00:15:18,216 --> 00:15:19,126
Carol, Kristen.

217
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:20,928
How do you do?

218
00:15:21,176 --> 00:15:22,973
Carol teaches sixth grade.

219
00:15:23,376 --> 00:15:25,606
And Kristen. . . .

220
00:15:28,816 --> 00:15:31,046
Kristen does something. . .

221
00:15:32,536 --> 00:15:34,174
. . .that, funnily enough. . .

222
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:37,335
. . .wasn't even her major!

223
00:15:41,496 --> 00:15:42,895
What do we got there?

224
00:15:44,016 --> 00:15:46,007
A piece of silk boxer shorts. . .

225
00:15:46,616 --> 00:15:48,174
. . .some greeting cards. . .

226
00:15:48,816 --> 00:15:51,694
. . .what looks like a
half-charred picture of. . . .

227
00:15:52,336 --> 00:15:54,725
Wow! That guy's hairier
than the chief!

228
00:15:58,216 --> 00:16:01,413
You know, it's a really funny story
how this happened.

229
00:16:01,656 --> 00:16:03,328
It's all right. Don't explain.

230
00:16:03,536 --> 00:16:06,528
It's not the first boyfriend bonfire
to get out of control.

231
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:11,331
-You're our third call tonight.
-Really?

232
00:16:11,576 --> 00:16:14,534
Sure. Valentine's is our
busiest night of the year!

233
00:16:17,896 --> 00:16:19,375
I brought you something.

234
00:16:19,576 --> 00:16:21,009
Is it loaded?

235
00:16:24,976 --> 00:16:27,046
Oh, little candy hearts!

236
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,930
''Chan and Jan forever! ''

237
00:16:31,336 --> 00:16:33,372
I had them made special.

238
00:16:37,016 --> 00:16:38,210
Okay, Janice.

239
00:16:39,296 --> 00:16:40,251
Janice.

240
00:16:41,816 --> 00:16:42,885
Hey, Janice.

241
00:16:46,016 --> 00:16:48,132
There's no way for me
to tell you this.

242
00:16:48,376 --> 00:16:50,810
At least, no new way
for me to tell you this.

243
00:16:53,816 --> 00:16:56,489
I just don't think things
are gonna work out.

244
00:16:59,096 --> 00:17:00,245
That's fine.

245
00:17:04,016 --> 00:17:05,529
It is?

246
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:09,212
Because I know that this
isn't the end.

247
00:17:11,216 --> 00:17:13,571
Oh, no. You see, actually, it is.

248
00:17:13,816 --> 00:17:16,535
No, it isn't. Because you
won't let that happen.

249
00:17:16,776 --> 00:17:18,175
Don't you know it yet?

250
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:21,453
You love me, Chandler Bing!

251
00:17:25,496 --> 00:17:27,009
Oh, no, I don't.

252
00:17:27,736 --> 00:17:30,375
Then why do you think
we keep ending up together?

253
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:32,368
New Year's, who invited who?

254
00:17:32,616 --> 00:17:35,369
Valentine's, who asked who
into whose bed?

255
00:17:35,616 --> 00:17:36,446
I did, but--

256
00:17:36,696 --> 00:17:37,924
You seek me out!

257
00:17:38,176 --> 00:17:43,091
Something deep in your soul
calls out to me like a foghorn!

258
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:47,045
Janice! Janice!

259
00:17:47,336 --> 00:17:49,531
You want me! You need me!

260
00:17:49,816 --> 00:17:52,853
You can't live without me!

261
00:17:53,176 --> 00:17:54,655
And you know it!

262
00:17:55,016 --> 00:17:58,725
You just don't know you know it.

263
00:18:02,976 --> 00:18:04,011
See you.

264
00:18:10,696 --> 00:18:11,845
Call me!

265
00:18:20,096 --> 00:18:23,930
It's not true. I never called
your mother a wolverine.

266
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:26,570
You did so. I swear.
I swear to--

267
00:18:30,336 --> 00:18:32,611
How long has she been in the bathroom?

268
00:18:33,496 --> 00:18:36,533
I don't think she's in the bathroom.
Her coat is gone.

269
00:18:36,856 --> 00:18:38,767
Well, maybe it's cold in there.

270
00:18:41,096 --> 00:18:44,133
Maybe I screwed up the first date
I had in nine years.

271
00:18:44,376 --> 00:18:46,765
-That could be it.
-Oh, God.

272
00:18:48,016 --> 00:18:50,325
You know, this is still pretty hot.

273
00:18:54,896 --> 00:18:55,931
Mushroom.

274
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:58,371
Smile.

275
00:18:59,376 --> 00:19:03,130
They won't all be like this.
Some might even stay through dinner.

276
00:19:03,936 --> 00:19:06,496
-I'm sorry. That's not funny.
-No, it's just. . . .

277
00:19:07,216 --> 00:19:10,572
Well, you know the whole
getting-on-with-your-life thing?

278
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,772
Well, do I have to?

279
00:19:13,216 --> 00:19:17,846
I mean, well, I'm sitting here
with this cute woman. . .

280
00:19:18,096 --> 00:19:20,052
. . .and she's perfectly nice,
you know?

281
00:19:20,296 --> 00:19:22,093
But there's. . . .

282
00:19:23,336 --> 00:19:24,405
That's it.

283
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:30,126
And then I'm here talking to you,
and it's easy and it's fun.

284
00:19:30,376 --> 00:19:32,731
And I don't have to. . . .

285
00:19:33,136 --> 00:19:34,649
-I know.
-You know?

286
00:19:38,616 --> 00:19:40,527
Here's a wacky thought.

287
00:19:41,816 --> 00:19:44,728
Let's say you and I give it
another shot.

288
00:19:45,656 --> 00:19:47,806
I know what you're gonna say.
You're a lesbian.

289
00:19:49,936 --> 00:19:54,532
But what do you say we just
put that aside for now, you know?

290
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:57,165
Let's just stick a pin in it, okay?

291
00:19:57,416 --> 00:20:00,169
Because we're great together,
you know?

292
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,372
You can't deny it.

293
00:20:03,376 --> 00:20:05,651
And besides, you're carrying my baby.

294
00:20:05,896 --> 00:20:08,535
I mean, how perfect is that?

295
00:20:08,776 --> 00:20:11,734
You keep saying that,
but there's something right here.

296
00:20:11,936 --> 00:20:12,732
I love you.

297
00:20:20,696 --> 00:20:22,368
I love you too.

298
00:20:23,936 --> 00:20:25,574
-But--
-No ''but. '' No ''but. ''

299
00:20:27,496 --> 00:20:30,533
You know that thing they
put over here with the pin in it?

300
00:20:33,336 --> 00:20:35,804
It's time to take the pin out.

301
00:20:42,016 --> 00:20:45,770
You'll find someone, I know you will.
The right woman is waiting for you.

302
00:20:46,016 --> 00:20:48,735
It's easy for you to say.
You found one already.

303
00:20:51,136 --> 00:20:53,889
All you need is a woman who likes men
and you'll be set.

304
00:20:57,976 --> 00:20:59,125
Not her.

305
00:21:09,896 --> 00:21:12,729
We get off around midnight.
Why don't we pick you up then?

306
00:21:14,616 --> 00:21:17,130
So will you bring the truck?

307
00:21:19,536 --> 00:21:21,527
I'll even let you ring the bell.

308
00:21:22,096 --> 00:21:24,929
-We'll see you later.
-Bye! See you later!

309
00:21:25,136 --> 00:21:26,774
Thanks. See you.

310
00:21:27,016 --> 00:21:28,210
Oh, my God!

311
00:21:29,296 --> 00:21:30,934
See, there you go.

312
00:21:31,176 --> 00:21:33,451
-The cleansing worked.
-You're right!

313
00:21:33,696 --> 00:21:35,095
They're nice guys!

314
00:21:35,496 --> 00:21:37,612
They're firemen guys!

315
00:21:39,176 --> 00:21:40,768
-You tell them you're married?
-No way!

316
00:21:41,016 --> 00:21:43,735
My girlfriend doesn't know.
I'm not gonna tell them!
