00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:18,549
-I'm sorry!
-That is it!

2
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:21,218
You barge in here
and you don't knock?

3
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:24,948
You have no respect for privacy.
No, you wait!

4
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:27,557
-Can I just say one thing?
-What?!

5
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:31,126
That's a relatively open weave.
I can still see...

6
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,693
...your nippular areas.

7
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:40,264
The One With The Boobies

8
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:30,117
Honey, tell them the story
about your patient...

9
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:32,621
...who thinks things are
other things.

10
00:01:33,059 --> 00:01:35,994
When the phone rings
and she takes a shower.

11
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:39,526
That's pretty much it.

12
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,699
-But you tell it really well, sweetie.
-Thanks. Okay.

13
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:48,465
Now go away so we can
talk about you.

14
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:50,442
Okay. I'll miss you.

15
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:56,137
-lsn't he great?
-He's cute. He likes you so much.

16
00:01:56,349 --> 00:02:00,410
I know. He's so sweet.
And so complicated, you know?

17
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:03,679
And for a shrink,
he's not too shrinky.

18
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,084
Think you'll do it on his couch?

19
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:09,090
I don't know. That's a little weird.

20
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:10,762
It's vinyl.

21
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:16,365
Okay, you guys want anything else?

22
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:20,198
-Could I have?
-We're all out. Anybody else?

23
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,703
Did I miss something?

24
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:26,139
No, she's still upset
because I saw her boobies.

25
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:29,881
What were you doing
seeing her boobies?

26
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:35,645
It was an accident. I wasn't
across the street with a telescope.

27
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:38,585
Can we change the subject, please?

28
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:43,023
These aren't her "boobies."
These are her breasts.

29
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:47,666
Pheebs, I was hoping
for more of a change.

30
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:50,859
I always liked "Bazoombas."

31
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,662
Gives them a Latin spin.

32
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,309
Can we drop this already, please?

33
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:01,841
Why are you embarrassed?
They were very nice boobies.

34
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:05,744
"Nice"? They were "nice"?

35
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,749
That's it?
I mean, mittens are "nice."

36
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:14,224
Okay. Rock, hard place. Me.

37
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:22,364
You're so funny!

38
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,400
He's really funny.

39
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:28,535
I wouldn't wanna be there
when the laughter stops.

40
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:31,903
Whoa, back up there, sparky.

41
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:34,879
What did you mean by that?

42
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:38,411
It seems that maybe
you have intimacy issues...

43
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:42,519
...that you use your humor
to keep people at a distance.

44
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:48,721
I mean, I just met you.
I don't know you from Adam.

45
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:50,856
Only child, right?

46
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:55,029
Parents divorced
before you hit puberty.

47
00:03:57,036 --> 00:04:00,062
-How did you know that?
-It's textbook.

48
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:06,145
Hey, you guys.
You all know my dad, right?

49
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,337
-How long are you in the city?
-Two days. I got a job.

50
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,744
I'm better off staying with Joey...

51
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:15,580
...than going back and forth
on the ferry.

52
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:18,848
-I don't know this one.
-This is my friend Roger.

53
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,821
-Good to meet you.
-You too.

54
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,928
-What happened to the puppet guy?
-Dad.

55
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:29,858
Oh, excuse me.
So, Ross, how's the wife?

56
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,830
0 for 2, huh?

57
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:36,733
Chandler, say something funny.

58
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,613
I gotta go. Miss you too.

59
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:52,857
-I love you, but it's getting late
-Say hi. Hey, Ma.

60
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,755
I made the appointment
with Dr. Bassida and

61
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,058
Excuse me?

62
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:05,097
Did you know this isn't Ma?

63
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,545
Her name's Ronni.

64
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,678
She's a pet mortician.

65
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:22,914
Sure.

66
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,890
So, how long you been...?

67
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:32,692
Remember when you were a kid,
I'd take you to the navy yard?

68
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:36,528
-Since then?
-No, it's only been six years.

69
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:41,969
I wanted you to think of a nice memory
so you'd know I'm not a terrible guy.

70
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,074
-What are you doing?
-Chopping garlic.

71
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,871
You don't crush it?

72
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:52,518
You're having an affair,
I chop garlic. It's a wacky world.

73
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,017
Joe, you ever been in love?

74
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:00,949
-I don't know.
-Then you haven't.

75
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:04,495
-You're burning tomatoes.
-You're one to talk.

76
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:12,136
Your dad's in love. The worst part is,
it's with two different women.

77
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:15,397
Oh, man! Please tell me
one of them is Ma.

78
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:19,669
Of course one of them's Ma.
What's the matter with you?

79
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,681
It's like if you woke up
and found out...

80
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:32,152
...your dad leads this double life.

81
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:36,351
He's like actually some spy
working for the ClA.

82
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:38,294
That'd be cool.

83
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,531
This blows!

84
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,360
Do you think Dad cheated?

85
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:46,231
I don't think so.
That would involve sex.

86
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:49,875
I'd like to think that our parents
don't do that.

87
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,874
I know. Why can't parents
just stay parents?

88
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:01,144
Why do they have to become people?
Why do they have?

89
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:02,743
Why...

90
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:08,257
...can't you stop staring
at my breasts?

91
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:10,823
What?

92
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:14,396
What?

93
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,965
Didn't you get a good enough look?

94
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:22,437
We're all adults here.
There's only one way to resolve this.

95
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:26,975
Since you saw her boobies you have
to show her your pee-pee.

96
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:39,184
You know,
I don't see that happening.

97
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,291
Come on. He's right. Tit for tat.

98
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,691
Well, I'm not showing you my tat!

99
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:56,273
-It's Phoebe.
-And Rog!

100
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,868
Come on up.

101
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:01,911
Oh, good! Rog is here.

102
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:08,515
-What's the matter with Rog?
-It's a little thing. I hate that guy!

103
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:12,851
So he was a little analytical.
That's what he does.

104
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:14,957
Come on, he's not that bad.

105
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:17,924
You're wrong! Why would I marry her...

106
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:20,961
...if I thought that she was
a lesbian?

107
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:25,270
I don't know. Maybe you wanted
your marriage to fail.

108
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:34,474
Why? Why would l? Why?

109
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,514
I don't know. Maybe low self-esteem?

110
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:43,381
Maybe to compensate
for overshadowing a sibling. Maybe

111
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:46,080
Wait! Go back to that "sibling" thing.

112
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,692
Well, I don't know.

113
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:52,058
You could've sabotaged
your marriage...

114
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:55,926
...so the sibling would feel like
less of a failure.

115
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:03,664
That's ridiculous!
I don't feel guilty for her failures.

116
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,140
-You think I'm a failure?
-lsn't he good?

117
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:12,545
Yeah. No, that's not
what I was saying.

118
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,777
I thought you were on my side.

119
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:18,683
But maybe you sucked up
to them so they'd favor you.

120
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:22,622
I married a lesbian
to make you look good!

121
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:29,132
You're right. I mean, you're right.

122
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:33,236
It wasn't just the Weebles,
but the Weeble Play Palace...

123
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:38,071
...and the Weeble's Cruise Ship...

124
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:42,212
...with this lifeboat
for the Weebles to wobble in.

125
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:46,776
And Mom just gave them all away.

126
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,050
That's tough, tough stuff.

127
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,521
Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie,
we gotta go.

128
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:57,457
-Feel better.
-We're gonna be late, sweetie.

129
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:00,461
-Thanks for everything, Mon.
-No problem.

130
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:04,061
Listen, it was great seeing you again.

131
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:08,271
Mon, easy on those cookies, okay?

132
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:12,170
Remember, they're just food,
they're not love.

133
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,409
I hate that guy!

134
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,352
Good night, you guys.

135
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:29,020
Oh, look. It's the woman we ordered.

136
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,326
Hey, can we help you?

137
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,895
No, thanks. I'm just waiting
for Joey Tribbiani.

138
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,872
I'm Joey Tribbiani.

139
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:46,935
Oh, no, not you. Big Joey. Oh, my God!

140
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:49,706
You're so much cuter than
your pictures.

141
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,876
I'm Ronni.

142
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,248
Cheese Nip?

143
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:04,820
Joey's having an embolism,
but I'd go for a nip.

144
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:13,663
Most people,
when their pets pass on...

145
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:16,535
...want them like they're sleeping.

146
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:20,769
Occasionally you get a person
who wants them in a pose.

147
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,107
Like chasing their tail.

148
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:27,382
Or jumping to catch a Frisbee.

149
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:31,954
Joey, if I go first,
I wanna be looking for my keys.

150
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,917
-That's a good one!
-Hey.

151
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:37,357
Hey, Dad. Ronni's here.

152
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:39,656
-Hi.
-Hey.

153
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:44,461
Hello, babe! What are you doing here?

154
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,537
Oh, you left your hair at my place.

155
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,038
I thought you'd need it tomorrow.

156
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,737
Thank you.

157
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:58,677
So, who's up for a big
game of Kerplunk?

158
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:06,114
Look, I shouldn't have come.

159
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,622
I better go. I'll miss the train.

160
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:12,992
-I don't want you taking that thing.
-Where do I stay? Here?

161
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:17,192
We'll go to a hotel.

162
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:19,537
We'll go to a hotel.

163
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:22,263
-No, you won't.
-No, we won't.

164
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:25,372
If you go to a hotel,
you'll be doing stuff.

165
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:28,409
I want you here so I can
keep an eye on you.

166
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:31,606
-You're gonna keep an eye on us?
-Right.

167
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:34,376
As long as you are under my roof...

168
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,987
...you're gonna live by my rules.

169
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,392
That means no sleeping
with your girlfriend.

170
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:46,791
Wow, he's strict.

171
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:51,064
Dad, you'll be in my room.
You can stay in Chandler's room.

172
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,170
And Chandler will be?

173
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:55,832
Out here with me, bunking up.

174
00:12:56,041 --> 00:13:00,478
Oh, bunking up. If you smell s'mores,
don't be alarmed.

175
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:03,170
Thanks. You're a good kid.

176
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:05,373
I'll show you to my room.

177
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:10,988
That sounds weird not followed by,
"No, it's late."

178
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:20,155
This is just for tonight.
Tomorrow you gotta change.

179
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:21,390
Change?

180
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,568
-Break up with Ronni
-I can't!

181
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:26,930
Then come clean with Ma!
This is not right!

182
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,733
I don't wanna hear it!
Now go to my room!

183
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:45,314
Hey, kickie!

184
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:50,521
-What are you doing?
-Getting comfortable.

185
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:54,095
-I can't sleep in my underwear.
-Well, you're gonna.

186
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:05,636
I was thinking about how I'm always
seeing girls on top of girls....

187
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:11,579
Are they end-to-end,
or tall, like pancakes?

188
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,210
You know, how I date all these women.

189
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:18,581
I always figured, when the right one
comes along...

190
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,760
... I'll be able to go the distance.

191
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,518
Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking

192
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,062
You're not him, you're you.

193
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,868
When they wanted you in
your father's business, did you cave?

194
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:33,129
-No.
-No.

195
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:36,740
You chose
the out-of-work-actor business.

196
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,010
That wasn't easy, but you did it.

197
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:43,580
I believe when the right woman
comes along...

198
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:48,685
...you'll have the guts to say,
"No, thanks, I'm married."

199
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:57,789
-You really think so?
-Yeah, I really do.

200
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:00,056
-Thanks, Chandler.
-Get off!

201
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:14,643
-Hi.
-Hi. May I help you?

202
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:19,875
Joey said I could use your shower
since Chandler's in ours.

203
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,575
Okay. Who are you?

204
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,148
Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rapalono.

205
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:27,621
The mistress?

206
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,392
-Come on in.
-Thanks.

207
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,531
I'm Rachel. Bathroom's there.

208
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:37,167
Ronni, how long has Chandler
been in the shower?

209
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:40,133
Oh, like five minutes.

210
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:41,499
Perfect.

211
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:47,874
Fasten your seat belts,
it's pee-pee time.

212
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:56,282
-Hey, Mr. Trib.
-Hey, good morning, dear.

213
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:02,082
Chandler Bing,
it's time to see your thing.

214
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:17,407
-What's with you?
-I thought it was Chandler!

215
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:21,306
You were supposed to be in there
so I'd see your thing!

216
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,648
Sorry, my thing was in there with me.

217
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:36,617
-How's it going?
-Good.

218
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:41,323
Roger's having a dinner thing.
He wanted me to invite you guys.

219
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:47,334
-So, what's going on?
-Nothing.

220
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:48,733
It's just....

221
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:52,035
It's Roger, you know?

222
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:54,007
There's something about

223
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:56,272
We just feel that he's....

224
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:59,039
-We hate that guy!
-We hate him!

225
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:02,149
-We're sorry, Pheebs.
-Okay.

226
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,881
Don't you think it's just that
he's so perceptive...

227
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,750
...it freaked you out?

228
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,757
No, we hate him!

229
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,122
I'm sorry.

230
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:29,847
-Ma! What are you doing here?
-I came to give you this and this!

231
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,807
Big ring!

232
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:35,316
Why'd you fill your father's head
with garbage...

233
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:37,751
...about making things right?

234
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,249
Things were fine this way!

235
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:43,154
There's chicken in there. Put it away.

236
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:46,222
For God's sake, Joey! Really.

237
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:53,166
-Hold on. You knew?
-Of course I knew. What do you think?

238
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,431
Your father is no James Bond.

239
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:57,834
You should've heard his stories.

240
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:00,534
"I'm sleeping over
at my accountant's."

241
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:04,842
-What is that? Please!
-So then, how could you?

242
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,712
Do you remember
how your father used to be?

243
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,117
Always yelling.
Nothing made him happy.

244
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:16,090
Not that wood shop, not those
stupid little ships in the bottle.

245
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:20,595
Now he's happy. I mean, it's nice.
He has a hobby.

246
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:26,262
Ma, I don't mean
to be disrespectful...

247
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:29,568
... but what the hell
are you talking about?

248
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:33,706
-I mean, what about you?
-Me? I'm fine.

249
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:37,746
Look, honey, in an ideal world...

250
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:42,319
...there'd be no her and your father
would look like Sting.

251
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:45,016
And something else:

252
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:48,682
Ever since that
poodle-stuffer came along...

253
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:53,331
... he's so ashamed of himself
that he's been more attentive.

254
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:58,026
He's been more loving. It's like
every day is our anniversary.

255
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,533
-I'm happy for you?
-Well, don't be!

256
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,906
Now everything's screwed up.

257
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:10,643
I just want it the way it was.

258
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,783
Ma, I'm sorry.

259
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:17,182
I just did what
I thought you'd want.

260
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:21,657
I know you did, cookie.
I know you did.

261
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:28,657
So tell me. Did you see her?

262
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:31,463
Yeah.

263
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:36,300
-You're 10 times prettier than she is.
-That's sweet.

264
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,000
Could I take her?

265
00:19:41,146 --> 00:19:43,478
With this ring, no contest.

266
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,119
Oh, no! Don't ever do that!

267
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:58,523
-What?
-I'm sorry.

268
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:02,257
I have a thing,
which means you can't ever do that!

269
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:08,228
-What's wrong, sweetie?
-Nothing.

270
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,238
-No, what's wrong? Come on.
-Okay.

271
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:19,550
It's nothing. I'm fine.
It's just It's my friends.

272
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:22,445
They have a liking problem with you...

273
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,554
...in that they don't.

274
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,286
They don't?

275
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:35,696
But they don't see all
the wonderfulness that I see.

276
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:39,426
They don't see all the good
and sweet stuff.

277
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:43,038
-They think you're a little
-What?

278
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,641
Intense and creepy.

279
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:51,246
-Oh.
-But I don't. Me, Phoebe.

280
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:58,321
-I'm not at all surprised about that.
-That's why you're so great.

281
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:00,817
It's quite typical behavior...

282
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:05,256
...when you have this kind
of dysfunctional group dynamic.

283
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:09,958
You know, this kind of codependent,
emotionally stunted...

284
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:15,502
...sitting in your stupid coffeehouse,
with your stupid big cups...

285
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:19,143
...which might as well
have nipples on them.

286
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:24,806
And you're all like,
"Oh, define me! Define me!

287
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,814
Love me! I need love!

288
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:30,948
You talked to your dad?

289
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:34,250
He's gonna keep cheating on Ma
like she wanted.

290
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,155
Ma will keep pretending
she doesn't know.

291
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:40,058
And my sister, Tina,
can't see her husband.

292
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:42,324
He got a restraining order.

293
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:46,762
Which has nothing to do with it.
I found out today.

294
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:51,272
Things have changed here
on Waltons'mountain.

295
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:55,736
-So, Joey, are you okay?
-Yeah, I guess.

296
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:58,347
It's just You know, they're parents.

297
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:01,383
After a certain point,
you gotta let go.

298
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:05,914
You gotta let them
make their own mistakes.

299
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,692
And think, in a few years,
we'll turn into them.

300
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:11,192
Oh, please.

301
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:15,730
If I turn into my parents, I'll be
an alcoholic blond chasing men...

302
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:19,233
...or I'll end up like my mom!

303
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,609
-Hey.
-Hey, Pheebs.

304
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:27,506
How's it going?

305
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:30,546
Okay, except I broke up with Roger.

306
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:35,346
-Yeah, right.
-No, no, really.

307
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:41,353
-What happened?
