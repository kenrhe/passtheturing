1
00:00:02,468 --> 00:00:04,743
Here's little Ben nodding off.

2
00:00:05,389 --> 00:00:07,698
Look at Aunt Monica's Little boy.

3
00:00:07,948 --> 00:00:11,099
-Look, he's got Ross' hair cut.
-Let me see.

4
00:00:11,948 --> 00:00:14,907
Oh, God!
Is he just the sweetest thing?

5
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:17,946
You must just want
to kiss him all over.

6
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:23,699
That would be nice.

7
00:00:26,548 --> 00:00:27,344
Pardon?

8
00:00:27,548 --> 00:00:30,507
Nothing. Just a Little
extra air in my mouth.

9
00:00:35,548 --> 00:00:38,859
Chan, can you help me out here?
I promise I'II pay you back.

10
00:00:39,069 --> 00:00:41,741
Yeah, right.
Including the waffles last week. . .

11
00:00:41,988 --> 00:00:43,421
. . .you now owe me. . .

12
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:45,905
. . . 17 jillion dollars.

13
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,307
Really, I'II pay you back this time.

14
00:00:49,069 --> 00:00:50,899
Where's the money coming from?

15
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:54,424
I'm helping out at the NYU
Med School with some research.

16
00:00:54,628 --> 00:00:56,186
What kind of research?

17
00:00:58,149 --> 00:00:59,945
Just, you know, science.

18
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:02,301
Science.

19
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:06,185
Yeah, I think I've heard of that.

20
00:01:08,509 --> 00:01:10,227
It's a fertility study.

21
00:01:13,308 --> 00:01:16,106
Please tell me you're only
donating your time.

22
00:01:17,789 --> 00:01:20,302
Come on, you guys.
It's not that big a deal.

23
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:22,784
I just go down there
every other day. . .

24
00:01:23,188 --> 00:01:26,100
. . .and make my contribution
to the project.

25
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:29,063
But at the end of two weeks,
I get $ 700!

26
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:32,902
You're gonna be making money
hand over fist.

27
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:37,338
The One Where Rachel Finds Out

28
00:01:38,629 --> 00:01:39,617
English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

29
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:24,463
Okay, we got the coleslaw.
We got the buns.

30
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:28,747
We've got the ground-up flesh
of formally cute cows and turkeys.

31
00:02:30,588 --> 00:02:31,907
Men are here!

32
00:02:37,468 --> 00:02:38,901
We make fire.

33
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:42,348
Cook meat.

34
00:02:42,588 --> 00:02:45,421
Then put out fire by peeing,
no get invited back!

35
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:46,862
Cute, cute!

36
00:02:47,149 --> 00:02:49,343
Joey, Melanie called.
She's gonna be late.

37
00:02:50,149 --> 00:02:51,627
So how are things going?

38
00:02:51,868 --> 00:02:54,383
Is she becoming your special someone?

39
00:02:56,389 --> 00:02:59,108
I don't know.
She's pretty great.

40
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:02,506
What does she think of
your Little science project?

41
00:03:03,788 --> 00:03:07,098
You think I'd tell a girl I like
that I'm also seeing a cup?

42
00:03:10,908 --> 00:03:12,307
The man's got a point.

43
00:03:12,588 --> 00:03:16,025
The tough thing is, she really wants
to have sex with me.

44
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:18,099
Crazy bitch!

45
00:03:23,068 --> 00:03:26,425
I got a week left in the program,
and according to the rules. . .

46
00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:30,298
. . .to get the money, I can't conduct
any personal experiments. . .

47
00:03:30,508 --> 00:03:31,942
. . .if you know what I mean.

48
00:03:32,188 --> 00:03:34,224
Joey, we always know what you mean.

49
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:45,705
How long did you think
this barbecue was gonna Last?

50
00:03:46,188 --> 00:03:47,417
I'm going to China.

51
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:49,425
Jeez, you say one thing and. . . .

52
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:52,383
You're going to China?

53
00:03:52,588 --> 00:03:55,182
It's for the museum.
Someone found a bone.

54
00:03:55,389 --> 00:03:57,344
They don't want us
to have the bone.

55
00:03:57,588 --> 00:04:01,627
So I'm going to try to persuade them--
It's a whole big bone thing.

56
00:04:03,068 --> 00:04:05,343
Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for a week.

57
00:04:05,588 --> 00:04:09,901
So if you wanna reach me, you can't.
So here's my itinerary.

58
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,302
-Here's a picture of me.
-Oh, let me see.

59
00:04:14,908 --> 00:04:18,867
Could you show it to Ben now and then
so he doesn't forget me?

60
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:21,223
Hi, Ben.

61
00:04:21,468 --> 00:04:23,187
I'm your father.

62
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:27,504
I am The Head!

63
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:34,300
This barbecue's gonna be fun.

64
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:39,184
Is Rachel here? I wanted to wish her
a happy birthday before I Left.

65
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:41,504
She's out having drinks with Carl.

66
00:04:42,588 --> 00:04:44,101
Hey, who's Carl?

67
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:48,903
You know, that guy she met
at the coffeehouse.

68
00:04:49,149 --> 00:04:53,141
-See, there's this guy she met at--
-The coffeehouse? Right.

69
00:04:53,908 --> 00:04:55,627
So you do know who he is.

70
00:04:59,908 --> 00:05:01,740
I'm gonna go say goodbye
to the guys.

71
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:04,416
You know what?
Tell them that bone story.

72
00:05:12,069 --> 00:05:14,458
-I have to go to China.
-The country?

73
00:05:16,269 --> 00:05:19,420
No, this big pile of dishes
in my mom's breakfront.

74
00:05:21,348 --> 00:05:22,781
Do you guys know who Carl is?

75
00:05:22,988 --> 00:05:26,220
Let's see.
Alvin, Simon, Theodore. . . .

76
00:05:28,749 --> 00:05:31,103
Rachel’s having
drinks with him tonight.

77
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:33,822
How can she, when she's never
shown interest in you?

78
00:05:35,588 --> 00:05:37,021
Forget about her.

79
00:05:37,228 --> 00:05:41,108
He's right, man. Please move on.
Go to China. Eat Chinese food.

80
00:05:41,548 --> 00:05:44,016
Of course, there,
they just call it food.

81
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:47,946
I guess. I don't know.

82
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:51,906
AII right, just give her this
for me, okay?

83
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:55,504
We're just looking out for you.
We want you to be happy.

84
00:05:55,749 --> 00:05:59,423
And I may only have a couple beers
in me, but I love you, man.

85
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:03,660
I'm still on my first.

86
00:06:06,468 --> 00:06:08,060
I just think you're nice.

87
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:18,737
That's when me and my friends
started this fruit-basket business.

88
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:22,908
We call ourselves
''The Three Basketeers. ''

89
00:06:23,548 --> 00:06:26,302
Like ''The Three Musketeers,''
only with fruit.

90
00:06:32,908 --> 00:06:35,742
-How do you Like your burgers?
-No. Presents first, food later!

91
00:06:37,788 --> 00:06:38,937
Hold on there, tiger.

92
00:06:39,908 --> 00:06:41,182
How are you holding up?

93
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:42,742
Well, not so good.

94
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:46,338
She thinks we're gonna
complete the transaction tonight. . .

95
00:06:46,548 --> 00:06:47,822
. . .if you know what I--

96
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:49,343
And you do!

97
00:06:49,988 --> 00:06:53,026
So have you ever thought about
being there for her?

98
00:06:53,548 --> 00:06:54,901
What do you mean?

99
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,269
You know, just be there for her.

100
00:07:03,788 --> 00:07:05,302
Not following you.

101
00:07:08,988 --> 00:07:10,307
Think about it.

102
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:20,100
I'm guessing this is from. . . .

103
00:07:22,988 --> 00:07:24,706
Well, thank you, Melanie.

104
00:07:24,988 --> 00:07:27,105
This one right here is from me.

105
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:29,708
It's light.

106
00:07:30,189 --> 00:07:31,303
It rattles.

107
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:32,497
It's. . .

108
00:07:34,108 --> 00:07:36,303
. . .Travel Scrabble!

109
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:40,504
Thank you.

110
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:45,937
This one's from Joey.

111
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:47,661
It feels Like a book.
I think it's a book.

112
00:07:48,348 --> 00:07:50,259
And it's a book!

113
00:07:50,988 --> 00:07:51,978
It's Dr. Seuss!

114
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:55,978
That book got me through
some tough times.

115
00:07:57,829 --> 00:08:00,343
There is a Little child
inside this man.

116
00:08:00,548 --> 00:08:03,346
The doctors say if they remove it,
he'll die!

117
00:08:06,228 --> 00:08:08,139
-Who's this from?
-That's Ross' .

118
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:15,502
Oh, my God!

119
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:18,096
He remembered!

120
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:19,497
Remembered what?

121
00:08:19,908 --> 00:08:21,137
It was months ago.

122
00:08:21,348 --> 00:08:24,704
We were walking by this antique store,
and I saw this pin.

123
00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:29,420
I told him it was just Like one
my grandmother had when I was Little.

124
00:08:29,668 --> 00:08:31,978
I can't believe he remembered!

125
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:35,107
Well, sure, but can you
play it on a plane?

126
00:08:40,548 --> 00:08:42,504
It's so pretty!

127
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,142
This must've cost him a fortune.

128
00:08:44,349 --> 00:08:45,464
I can't believe he did this.

129
00:08:45,668 --> 00:08:47,899
Remember when he
fell in Love with Carol. . .

130
00:08:48,109 --> 00:08:51,499
. . .and bought her that ridiculously
expensive crystal duck?

131
00:08:52,668 --> 00:08:53,703
What did you say?

132
00:09:05,749 --> 00:09:07,148
Crystal duck.

133
00:09:14,989 --> 00:09:16,626
The ''Love'' part?

134
00:09:22,788 --> 00:09:25,701
Oh, my God!

135
00:09:29,188 --> 00:09:31,418
That's good.
Just keep rubbing your head.

136
00:09:31,668 --> 00:09:33,500
That'll turn back time.

137
00:09:38,989 --> 00:09:42,264
This is unbelievable.
I mean, this is unbelievable!

138
00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:45,023
I know.
This is really, really huge!

139
00:09:45,349 --> 00:09:49,547
No, it's not. It's small,
it's tiny, it's petite, it's wee.

140
00:09:50,948 --> 00:09:54,543
I don't think any of our lives
will ever be the same ever again!

141
00:09:55,908 --> 00:09:58,376
Is there a mute button
on this woman?

142
00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:01,820
I think this is so great!
I mean, you and Ross!

143
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,342
Did you have any idea?

144
00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:05,147
No, none!

145
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:08,426
My first night in the city,
he mentioned asking me out. . .

146
00:10:08,668 --> 00:10:11,102
. . .but nothing ever happened,
so I just. . . .

147
00:10:11,349 --> 00:10:14,307
What else did he say?
Does he want to go out with me?

148
00:10:14,589 --> 00:10:16,341
Given that he's desperately
in Love with you. . .

149
00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:19,500
. . .he wouldn’t mind getting
a cup of coffee or something.

150
00:10:20,509 --> 00:10:21,702
Ross?

151
00:10:22,349 --> 00:10:23,941
AII this time?

152
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:26,304
-I've gotta talk to him.
-He's in China!

153
00:10:26,548 --> 00:10:27,663
The country.

154
00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:32,062
Wait, his flight doesn't leave
for 45 minutes.

155
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:35,385
-What about the time difference?
-From here to the airport?

156
00:10:37,188 --> 00:10:39,623
-You're never gonna make it!
-I've got to try.

157
00:10:39,828 --> 00:10:40,898
What'll you say to him?

158
00:10:41,948 --> 00:10:43,143
I don't know.

159
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:44,504
Then maybe you shouldn’t go.

160
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:48,224
Right, because if you're gonna
break his heart, that can wait.

161
00:10:48,469 --> 00:10:50,379
But if it's good news,
tell him now.

162
00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:52,067
Maybe I'II know when I see him.

163
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:54,702
Here, look.
AII right, does this help?

164
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:06,097
AII I know is, I cannot wait a week.
This is just too big.

165
00:11:06,308 --> 00:11:08,697
I've just got to talk to him.
I've got--

166
00:11:08,948 --> 00:11:10,143
I'II see you Later.

167
00:11:10,428 --> 00:11:11,225
I Love you!

168
00:11:12,469 --> 00:11:13,902
Deal with me first!

169
00:11:26,028 --> 00:11:26,825
AII right.

170
00:11:32,749 --> 00:11:34,227
Excuse me, pardon me.

171
00:11:34,469 --> 00:11:35,504
Your boarding pass?

172
00:11:35,749 --> 00:11:37,546
I don't have one.
I need to talk to my friend.

173
00:11:37,749 --> 00:11:41,537
Sorry, you're not allowed on
the jetway without a boarding pass.

174
00:11:41,749 --> 00:11:44,785
He's right there,
in the blue jacket! Can I just--?

175
00:11:44,989 --> 00:11:46,865
I'm sorry.
Federal regulations!

176
00:11:47,109 --> 00:11:50,942
AII right, then could you please
just give him a message for me?

177
00:11:51,188 --> 00:11:52,587
This is very important.

178
00:11:52,788 --> 00:11:55,019
AII right.
What's the message?

179
00:11:56,068 --> 00:11:57,706
I don't know.

180
00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:00,817
Excuse me! Sir!

181
00:12:01,068 --> 00:12:02,342
Excuse me! Sir?

182
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:04,147
I have a message for you.

183
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:08,302
Rachel said she loved the present.
She'll see you when you get back.

184
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:09,702
What?

185
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:14,147
Toby, I don't know
what she's talking about.

186
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:15,788
There's no Rachel!

187
00:12:16,188 --> 00:12:18,100
Don't give me that deep freeze!

188
00:12:27,068 --> 00:12:30,697
Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey!

189
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:34,301
I think I blacked out there
for a minute.

190
00:12:35,828 --> 00:12:37,307
It was nothing.

191
00:12:38,188 --> 00:12:41,898
Well, now we gotta
find something fun for you!

192
00:12:45,948 --> 00:12:47,381
You know what?

193
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:51,979
Forget about me.
Let's give you another turn.

194
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:55,663
Me, again?

195
00:12:55,869 --> 00:12:58,099
Sure. Why not?

196
00:13:00,749 --> 00:13:05,379
Boy! Somebody's gonna get
a big fruit basket tomorrow!

197
00:13:10,188 --> 00:13:14,546
I gotta tell you, you are nothing Like
I thought you would be.

198
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:15,658
How do you mean?

199
00:13:16,308 --> 00:13:21,099
I just had you pegged as one of those
guys who are always, ''Me, me, me! ''

200
00:13:21,349 --> 00:13:22,225
But you. . .

201
00:13:23,109 --> 00:13:24,258
. . .you're a giver.

202
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:27,943
You're, Like, the most generous
man I ever met.

203
00:13:28,188 --> 00:13:31,419
I mean, you're practically a woman.

204
00:13:37,548 --> 00:13:40,268
So Rach, do you want to save
this wrapping paper?

205
00:13:40,469 --> 00:13:41,697
It's only a Little torn.

206
00:13:41,948 --> 00:13:45,020
Are you gonna go for it with Ross,
or should I throw it out?

207
00:13:47,788 --> 00:13:49,107
I don't know.

208
00:13:49,668 --> 00:13:50,942
I don't know.

209
00:13:51,788 --> 00:13:53,938
I thought about it
all of the way there. . .

210
00:13:54,188 --> 00:13:57,306
. . .and I thought about it
all the way back and. . . .

211
00:13:57,548 --> 00:13:59,140
You know, it's Ross!

212
00:13:59,349 --> 00:14:01,499
You know what I mean?
It's Ross.

213
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:02,903
-Sure!
-Sure.

214
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:07,907
I don't know. This is just
my initial gut feeling. . .

215
00:14:09,109 --> 00:14:10,701
. . .but I'm thinking. . .

216
00:14:11,869 --> 00:14:13,062
. . .it'd be really great.

217
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,705
Oh, my God, me too!
We'd be Like friends-in-law!

218
00:14:17,989 --> 00:14:20,822
The best part is you already
know all about him.

219
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,184
It's Like starting on the 1 5th date.

220
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:26,698
But it would be Like
starting on the 1 5th date.

221
00:14:27,589 --> 00:14:29,341
Another good point.

222
00:14:31,349 --> 00:14:35,740
At the 1 5th date, you're already
in a ''relationship-py'' place.

223
00:14:35,989 --> 00:14:36,943
You're committed.

224
00:14:40,308 --> 00:14:42,504
What happens if it doesn't work out?

225
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:43,783
Why isn't it working out?

226
00:14:44,028 --> 00:14:45,667
Sometimes it doesn't.

227
00:14:45,869 --> 00:14:49,339
Is he not cute enough for you?
Does he not make enough money?

228
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:50,538
No, I'm just--

229
00:14:50,749 --> 00:14:52,148
Maybe there's someone else.

230
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:54,299
Is there?
Is there someone else?

231
00:14:54,548 --> 00:14:57,109
No, there is no one else.

232
00:14:57,349 --> 00:14:59,908
Then why the hell
are you dumping my brother?

233
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,302
Hey, big--

234
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:12,625
Spender!

235
00:15:15,469 --> 00:15:17,027
She's still asleep.

236
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:19,577
-So how'd it go?
-It was amazing!

237
00:15:20,068 --> 00:15:21,740
You know how you think
you're great in bed?

238
00:15:21,948 --> 00:15:25,339
The fact you'd even ask
shows how Little you know me.

239
00:15:25,948 --> 00:15:28,621
Well, Last night
I couldn’t do the thing. . .

240
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:30,706
. . .that usually makes me great.

241
00:15:30,908 --> 00:15:32,899
So I had to do
all this other stuff.

242
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:36,106
And the response I got!
Man, oh, man!

243
00:15:36,349 --> 00:15:38,340
It was Like
a ticker-tape parade!

244
00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:43,658
I know. My room's very close
to the parade route.

245
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:51,702
It was amazing,
and not just for her.

246
00:15:51,948 --> 00:15:52,745
For me too!

247
00:15:52,989 --> 00:15:55,947
It's Like, all of a sudden
I'm blind. . .

248
00:15:56,149 --> 00:15:58,139
. . .but all my other senses
are heightened.

249
00:15:58,428 --> 00:16:01,899
You know? It's Like,
I was able to appreciate it. . .

250
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:04,059
. . .on another level.

251
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:08,864
I didn't know you had
another Level.

252
00:16:09,349 --> 00:16:11,145
I know. Neither did I!

253
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:22,498
Hey, great skirts!
Birthday present?

254
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,107
-From who?
-From you!

255
00:16:24,308 --> 00:16:25,822
I exchanged the blouse
you got me.

256
00:16:27,948 --> 00:16:29,506
Well, it's the thought.

257
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:32,702
Doesn't Ross' flight get in
in a couple hours?

258
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,660
At gate 27B?

259
00:16:37,908 --> 00:16:40,139
I've been thinking about it.

260
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:43,664
I've decided this Ross thing
is not a good idea.

261
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:44,664
Why?

262
00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:48,144
Because I feel Like I wouldnÕt
just be going out with him.

263
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:50,504
I would be going out with
all of you.

264
00:16:50,749 --> 00:16:52,148
There'd be all this pressure and--

265
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:54,106
No pressure, no pressure!

266
00:16:55,788 --> 00:16:58,667
Nothing has even happened yet
and you're already so--

267
00:16:58,869 --> 00:17:00,143
I'm not ''so. ''

268
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:02,504
I was a teensy bit weird at first. . .

269
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:05,701
. . .but I'II be good.
I promise.

270
00:17:10,509 --> 00:17:11,419
Who is it?

271
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:12,942
It's me, Carl.

272
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:14,223
Come on up.

273
00:17:14,429 --> 00:17:16,101
Behind my brother's back?

274
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:21,223
Is the kind of crazy thing
you won't be hearing from me.

275
00:17:34,189 --> 00:17:35,304
Seven hundred bucks!

276
00:17:35,509 --> 00:17:37,339
AII right, you did it!

277
00:17:37,588 --> 00:17:38,942
Do we have any fruit?

278
00:17:41,868 --> 00:17:43,700
Man! A hell of a two weeks.

279
00:17:43,949 --> 00:17:46,861
You know what, though?
I really feel I learned something.

280
00:17:47,068 --> 00:17:49,583
So you'll stick with this
''it's all for her'' thing?

281
00:17:49,788 --> 00:17:51,301
What, are you crazy?

282
00:17:51,788 --> 00:17:55,906
When a blind man gets his sight back,
does he walk around Like this?

283
00:18:01,108 --> 00:18:04,703
I'm just saying, if I see one more
picture of Ed Begley Jr. . .

284
00:18:04,909 --> 00:18:06,705
. . .in that stupid electric car. . .

285
00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:08,228
. . .I'II shoot myself!

286
00:18:10,348 --> 00:18:13,340
Don't get me wrong. I'm not against
environmental issues, per se. . .

287
00:18:14,148 --> 00:18:15,787
. . .it's just that guy!

288
00:18:16,269 --> 00:18:19,704
I can't believe you'd rather
go out with him than me.

289
00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:23,307
Excuse me, please.
I'm trying to have a date here.

290
00:18:23,868 --> 00:18:25,859
Fine, just stop thinking about me.

291
00:18:29,269 --> 00:18:31,338
Can't do it, can you?

292
00:18:32,108 --> 00:18:34,338
So I'm thinking about you.
So what?

293
00:18:34,588 --> 00:18:37,625
I don't get it. What do you see
in this guy anyway?

294
00:18:38,749 --> 00:18:41,057
Well, he seems to be
a very nice guy.

295
00:18:41,308 --> 00:18:44,267
I mean, come on, buddy!
Get a real car!

296
00:18:47,189 --> 00:18:48,541
Rachel, come on.

297
00:18:48,788 --> 00:18:50,700
Give us a chance.

298
00:18:51,388 --> 00:18:52,902
It's too hard.

299
00:18:53,548 --> 00:18:55,346
Because it'll get weird
for everyone else?

300
00:18:55,588 --> 00:18:57,545
Who cares?
This is about us.

301
00:18:57,909 --> 00:19:01,105
I've been in Love with you
since the ninth grade.

302
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,909
-You're, Like, my best friend.
-I know.

303
00:19:04,108 --> 00:19:05,861
If we broke up, and I lost you--

304
00:19:06,068 --> 00:19:07,787
Why do you think
we'll break up?

305
00:19:08,028 --> 00:19:11,703
Have you been involved with someone
where you haven't broken up?

306
00:19:14,189 --> 00:19:14,984
No.

307
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:19,503
But it only has to happen once.

308
00:19:19,788 --> 00:19:22,747
You and I know
we are perfect for each other.

309
00:19:22,989 --> 00:19:23,943
Right?

310
00:19:24,509 --> 00:19:27,740
So the only question is:
Are you attracted to me?

311
00:19:29,788 --> 00:19:31,017
I don't know.

312
00:19:33,108 --> 00:19:35,906
I mean, I've never looked at you
that way before.

313
00:19:36,788 --> 00:19:38,188
Well start Looking!

314
00:19:49,469 --> 00:19:50,617
Exactly!
