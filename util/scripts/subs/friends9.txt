Terry, I know I haven't worked here
very long but would it be possible...

2
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:15,639
...if I got a $1 00 advance
on my salary?

3
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:17,513
An advance?

4
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:20,652
So I can spend
Thanksgiving with my family.

5
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:24,984
Every year we ski in Vail,
and my father pays for my ticket.

6
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:28,217
But I've started
this independent thing...

7
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:31,488
...which is actually why
I took this "job. "

8
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:35,932
Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart!

9
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:39,229
You' re a terrible, terrible waitress.

10
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:42,566
Really, really awful.

11
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:47,274
I hear what you're saying.
I'm with you.

12
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:53,549
But I'm trying really hard,
and I think I'm doing better.

13
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:55,983
I really do.

14
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:59,215
-Does anybody need coffee?
-Yeah, over here.

15
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:03,855
Look at that.

16
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,259
The One Where Underdog Gets Away

17
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:56,140
Excuse me, sir? Hi.
You come in here all the time.

18
00:01:56,349 --> 00:02:01,685
Do you think there's a possibility
that you could advance me my tips?

19
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:08,158
Okay, okay. That's fine. Fine.
Sorry about that spill before!

20
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:11,387
Only 98.50 to go!

21
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:17,532
Did you know Mom and Dad are going
to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?

22
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:21,730
-What? No, they're not.
-Yes, the Blymans invited them.

23
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,533
You' re wrong.

24
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:27,608
-I am not wrong.
-You' re wrong.

25
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:30,911
No, I just talked to them.

26
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:33,609
I' m calling Mom.

27
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:40,287
-Hey, hey.
-Hey!

28
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:46,731
And this from the Cry for Help
Department: Are you wearing makeup?

29
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:54,130
Yes, I am. As of today, I'm officially
Joey T ribbiani, actor/model.

30
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:59,937
That's funny. I was thinking you look
more like, Joey T ribbiani, man/woman.

31
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:04,915
-What were you modeling for?
-Posters for the free clinic.

32
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:08,679
So you' re gonna be one
of those healthy guys?

33
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:12,915
-The asthma guy's really cute.
-Know which one you'll be?

34
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:17,222
No, but I hear Lyme disease
is open, so you know....

35
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,888
-Good luck, man. I hope you get it.
-Thanks.

36
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:28,664
You were right. How can they do this?
It's Thanksgiving!

37
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:33,403
What if I cook dinner at my place?
I'll make it just like Mom's.

38
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:36,878
Will you make mashed potatoes
with the lumps?

39
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:42,080
They're not actually supposed to
I'll work on the lumps.

40
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:44,823
-Joey, you' re going home?
-Yeah.

41
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:49,461
Chandler, you' re still boycotting
all the pilgrim holidays?

42
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:54,532
-Every single one of them.
-Phoebe, you'll be with your grandma?

43
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,099
And her boyfriend.

44
00:03:56,302 --> 00:04:00,671
We're celebrating Thanksgiving
in December because he's lunar.

45
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,041
So you're free Thursday then?

46
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,613
-Yeah. Oh, can I come?
-Yeah.

47
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:16,518
-Rach, are you gonna make it to Vail?
-Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop.

48
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:20,352
-Only $1 02 to go.
-I thought it was 98. 50?

49
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,360
Yeah, well, it was, but l
I broke a cup, so....

50
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:29,264
-Well, l' m off to Carol's.
-Ooh, ooh, why don't we invite her?

51
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:34,796
Ooh, ooh, because she's my ex-wife
and will want to bring her...

52
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,806
...ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.

53
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,880
Hi. Is Carol here?

54
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:54,583
-No, she's at a faculty meeting.
-I just came by to pick up my skull.

55
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,957
Well, not mine, but....

56
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:00,294
-Come in.
-Thanks.

57
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,698
Carol borrowed it, and I have
to get it back to the museum.

58
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:09,807
-What's it look like?
-Kind of like a big face without skin.

59
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:15,046
Yes. I'm familiar with the concept.

60
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,808
-We can just look for it.
-Okay.

61
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:28,358
Wow, you guys sure have a lot
of books about being a lesbian.

62
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:35,494
Well, you know,
you have to take a course.

63
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:39,266
Otherwise they don't let you do it.

64
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:50,579
Hey, Yertle the Turtle! A classic.

65
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:54,583
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.

66
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:58,849
The baby that hasn't been born yet?

67
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:02,152
Wouldn't that mean you're crazy?

68
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:07,329
You don't think
they can hear sounds in there?

69
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:11,469
You' re not serious?
I mean, you really talk to it?

70
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:16,634
Yeah, all the time.
I want the baby to know my voice.

71
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:23,948
Well, that's just
Do you talk about me?

72
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:27,947
-Yeah. All the time.
-Really?

73
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:33,649
But, we just refer to you
as " Bobo the Sperm Guy. "

74
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:49,339
If she's talking to it, I just think
I should get some belly time too.

75
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,510
Not that I believe this.

76
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:55,374
I believe it. I think the baby
can hear everything.

77
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:58,482
-Really?
-I'll show you. This'll seem weird.

78
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:01,812
But you put your head
inside this turkey...

79
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:06,390
...and we'll all talk
and you'll hear everything we say.

80
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:11,987
I'd just like to say I'm totally
behind this experiment.

81
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:16,157
In fact, I'd very much like
to butter your head.

82
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:22,068
-Hey.
-Rach, did you make your money?

83
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:26,177
No, not even close. Forget Vail.
Forget seeing my family.

84
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:30,008
Forget shoop, shoop, shoop.

85
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:37,155
-Rach, here's your mail.
-Thanks. You can put it on the table.

86
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:41,019
No. Here's your mail!

87
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:45,787
Thanks. You can put it on the table!

88
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:48,125
Would you just open it!

89
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:55,739
Oh, my God! You guys are great!

90
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:58,206
We all chipped in.

91
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:01,073
-We did?
-You owe me $20.

92
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,840
Thank you. Thank you so much!

93
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,952
Chandler, got your traditional
holiday feast. T omato soup...

94
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:12,181
...grilled-cheese fixings
and a family-size bag of Funyuns.

95
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:17,920
This is your Thanksgiving dinner?
What is it with you and this holiday?

96
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:22,262
-I'm 9 years old.
-I hate this story!

97
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:26,734
We've finished this magnificent
Thanksgiving dinner. I have...

98
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:29,100
...a mouthful of pumpkin pie.

99
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:33,039
And then my parents tell me
they're getting divorced.

100
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:34,577
Oh, my God!

101
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:40,116
Very difficult to enjoy Thanksgiving
dinner once you've seen it in reverse.

102
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:46,586
What's this?
I never saw this at Mom's.

103
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:49,522
-It's a yam.
-Hello....

104
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:55,662
This isn't a yam.
Yam comes in purple cans.

105
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:59,267
They don't They don't come in these.

106
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:04,401
Ross, don't take this the wrong way
or anything, but back off.

107
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:19,588
Hi.

108
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,456
-We used to work together.
-We did?

109
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:27,224
Yeah, at Macy's.
You' re the Obsession girl, right?

110
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:30,425
-Yes.
-I was the Aramis guy.

111
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:36,341
-Aramis. Aramis. Aramis.
-Yeah, right!

112
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:40,643
-You' re the best in the business.
-Get out.

113
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:45,874
You' re amazing! You know when
to spritz. You know when to lay back.

114
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,953
Really? You don't know
what that means to me.

115
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:56,690
You smell great tonight.
What are you wearing?

116
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,454
Nothing.

117
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:13,135
-Listen, do you wanna go get a drink?
-Yeah, that would be

118
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,975
-What's wrong?
-I have to do something.

119
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:19,583
What?

120
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:25,788
-Leave.
-Wait, wait, wait!

121
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,564
So I guess you all saw it.

122
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,101
-What?
-Saw what?

123
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:17,037
No, we' re just laughing. You know
how laughter can be infectious.

124
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:40,992
Set another place for Thanksgiving.
My entire family thinks I have VD.

125
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:45,197
"T onight, on a very special Blossom. "

126
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:54,974
Looking good! Okay!

127
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:59,948
Cider's mulling, turkey's turkeying,
yams are yamming....

128
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,819
What?

129
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:06,788
I don't know. It's just not
the same without Mom in the kitchen.

130
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:09,358
Get out and stop annoying me!

131
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,393
Oh, that's closer.

132
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:14,595
I got the tickets!

133
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,896
Five hours from now,
shoop, shoop, shoop!

134
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:23,599
-Oh, you must stop shooping.
-Okay, l' m gonna get my stuff.

135
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:25,333
Will you come in?

136
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:29,776
I prefer to keep a safe distance
from all this merriment.

137
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:33,509
Look out! Incoming pumpkin pie!

138
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:44,523
We laughed when you did it with
the stuffing, but that's not funny.

139
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:49,498
Hey, Monica, I got a question.
I don't see any T ator T ots.

140
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:54,298
-That's not a question.
-My mom makes them. It's a tradition.

141
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:59,809
You get a piece of turkey on your fork,
a little cranberry sauce and a T ot!

142
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:06,610
I mean, it's bad enough I can't be
with my family because of my disease.

143
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,318
All right. Fine.

144
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:15,427
Tonight's potatoes will be mashed,
with lumps and in the form of Tots.

145
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:20,829
All right, I'm off
to talk to my unborn child.

146
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:24,700
Okay, Mom never hit.

147
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:30,936
Okay, all done.

148
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:36,137
Phoebe, did you whip the pota?
Ross needs lumps!

149
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:38,043
Oh, l' m sorry! I just

150
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:43,483
I thought we could have them whipped
and then add some peas and onions.

151
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:45,054
Why do that?

152
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:50,422
Because then they'd be just like my
mom used to make it, before she died.

153
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:55,999
Okay. Three kinds
of potatoes coming up.

154
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:01,069
Okay. Goodbye, you guys!
Thanks for everything!

155
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:05,334
Oh, God, look at
Sorry! I'm so sorry.

156
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:10,413
An unbelievable thing happened!
Underdog got away!

157
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:15,178
-The balloon?
-No, no, the actual cartoon character.

158
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:18,384
Of course the balloon!

159
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:23,358
He broke free and was spotted
flying over Washington Square Park.

160
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:27,191
-I'm going to the roof. Who's with me?
-I can't!

161
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:31,426
An 80-foot dog over the city?
How often does that happen?

162
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:32,968
Almost never.

163
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:36,664
-Got the keys?
-Okay.

164
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,710
Anytime you' re ready.

165
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:47,408
Okay. Okay, here we go.

166
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:55,523
Okay. Where am I talking to here?

167
00:14:56,428 --> 00:15:01,263
There is one way that offers a
certain acoustical advantage, but....

168
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:04,466
Just aim for the bump.

169
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:06,335
Okay.

170
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:10,569
Okay. Okay. Okay, here goes.

171
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:21,716
You know, I can't do this. This is

172
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,856
It's too weird. I feel stupid.

173
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:29,653
It's fine. You don't have to do it
just because Susan does it.

174
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:33,764
Hello, baby. Hello. Hello.

175
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:38,694
the moment we first saw
the dog shadow fall over the park!

176
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:42,897
But did they have to shoot him down?
That was just mean.

177
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:47,534
Right now the turkey should
be crispy on the outside...

178
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:50,044
...and juicy on the inside.

179
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:52,313
Why are we standing here?

180
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:56,545
We're waiting for you to open
the door. You have the keys.

181
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:58,313
No, I don't.

182
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:02,955
Yes, you do. When we left,
you said, "Got the keys. "

183
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:07,861
No, I didn't. I asked, "Got the keys? "

184
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:11,761
No, no, no. You said, "Got the keys! "

185
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,270
Do either of you have the keys?

186
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:19,076
-The oven is on!
-I've gotta get my ticket!

187
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:22,304
-Wait! We have a copy of your key.
-Get it!

188
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:25,449
That tone won't make me go any faster.

189
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,881
-Joey.
-That one will.

190
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:35,492
And everyone's telling me,
"You gotta pick a major. "

191
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:40,290
So on a dare, I picked paleontology.

192
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:45,937
And you have no idea what I'm saying,
because, face it, you' re a fetus.

193
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,399
You're happy you don't
have gills anymore.

194
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:54,670
You don't have to talk to it.
You can sing

195
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,543
Please. I am not singing
to your stomach, okay?

196
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,952
How's it going?

197
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,916
Here we come

198
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:05,352
Walking down the street

199
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:09,425
Get the funniest looks from
Everyone we meet

200
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:11,289
Hey, hey

201
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,933
-Hey, did you just feel that?
-I did.

202
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:19,934
-Does it always?
-That was the first.

203
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:22,198
IKeep singing! IKeep singing!

204
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:26,742
Hey, hey, you 're my baby
And I can 't wait to meet you

205
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:31,439
When you come out I'll buy you a bagel
Then we 'll go to the zoo

206
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,244
-lt did it again!
-I felt it that time!

207
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:39,117
Hey, hey, I'm your daddy
I'm the one without any breasts

208
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:47,288
This is great. It's 5:00. My plane
is pulling away from the gate.

209
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:50,935
-Maybe you can take a later flight.
-There is none.

210
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:54,867
-You can go tomorrow.
-T omorrow is not Thanksgiving!

211
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:59,101
If l' m gonna cheer you up,
you have to meet me halfway.

212
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:01,942
Can you go any faster?

213
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:06,275
I got one keyhole and a zillion keys!
You do the math.

214
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:10,012
Why do you guys have so many
keys in there anyway?

215
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:12,622
For an emergency just like this.

216
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:16,019
All right. Listen, smirky!

217
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:19,959
If not for your stupid balloon,
I'd be on a plane...

218
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:23,931
...watching a woman do this... right
now. But l' m not!

219
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,101
You said you had the keys!

220
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:31,902
No, I didn't! I wouldn't say I had
the keys unless I had the keys!

221
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:36,104
That's it! Enough with the keys.
No one say keys!

222
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:40,913
Why would I have the keys?!

223
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,385
-Aside from the fact you said you did?
-I didn't!

224
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,921
-You should've.
-Why?

225
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,114
-Because!
-Why?

226
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:52,093
Everything's my responsibility?
Isn't it enough that l' m making dinner?

227
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:56,529
Everyone wants a different kind
of potato, so I'm making them.

228
00:18:56,735 --> 00:19:01,695
Does anybody care what kind
of potatoes I want? No!

229
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:03,738
No! No!

230
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:08,936
Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas
and onions, and Mario gets his T ots

231
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:13,244
It's my first Thanksgiving, and l

232
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:16,512
It's all burnt, and I can't....

233
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:23,686
Monica, only dogs can hear you now.
Look, the door's open. Here we go.

234
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,735
-All right, Chandler, don't lose this.
-No

235
00:19:35,741 --> 00:19:38,801
Well, the turkey's burnt!

236
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:43,277
Potatoes are ruined! Potatoes
are ruined! Potatoes are ruined!

237
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:45,713
Here we come

238
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:47,886
Walking down the

239
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:52,617
This doesn't smell like Mom's.

240
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:59,894
It doesn't, does it? You wanted lumps?
Here you go, buddy. You got one!

241
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:05,531
-Don't yell at me. You burned dinner!
-Hey, don't make her squeak again!

242
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:11,609
God, this is great! The plane is gone.
I guess I'm stuck here with you guys.

243
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:15,906
We all had better plans.
This was nobody's first choice!

244
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:21,279
Oh, really? So why was I busting
my ass to make this delicious dinner?

245
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:24,649
-You call that delicious?
-You be quiet!

246
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:28,649
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

247
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,693
Now this feels like Thanksgiving.

248
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,498
Skiing.

249
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:44,231
Shoop, shoop, shoop....

250
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:45,967
Shoop.

251
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:49,443
-Eww.
-What?

252
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:53,584
Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey
out of the oven.

253
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:57,620
-Who cares?
-He just sat in gravy.

254
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,518
Oh, my God! He's not alone.

255
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:08,495
Ugly Naked Guy is having Thanksgiving
dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.

256
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,433
I gotta see this!

257
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:16,133
All right, Ugly Naked Guy!

258
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:19,210
Ugly naked dancing!

259
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:22,410
It's nice that he has someone.

260
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,183
Shall I carve?

261
00:21:35,594 --> 00:21:37,562
-By all means.
-All right.

262
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:46,295
Who wants light cheese,
and who wants dark cheese?

263
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:50,168
I don't even want to know
about the dark cheese.

264
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,935
-Does anybody wanna split this?
-I will.

265
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,546
-You guys have to make a wish.
-Make a wish?

266
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:59,478
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving.

267
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:07,285
You got the bigger half!
What did you wish for?

268
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,426
The bigger half.

269
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:14,160
All right, I'd like
to propose a toast.

270
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:16,766
A little toast here. Ding, ding!

271
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:19,664
This isn't the Thanksgiving
you planned...

272
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:23,830
...but for me,
this has been really great.

273
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:29,981
I think because it didn't involve
divorce or projectile vomiting.

274
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:35,647
If you'd gone to Vail
or if you had been with your family...

275
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:39,381
...or if you didn't have syphilis
and stuff...

276
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,995
...we wouldn't be together.

277
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,960
I guess what l' m trying
to say is that...

278
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:52,000
... I' m very thankful that all
of your Thanksgivings sucked.

279
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:56,239
-That's so sweet!
-Thank you.

280
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,771
-Here's to a lousy Christmas!
-And a crappy New Year!

281
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,505
-Hear, hear!
-Hear, hear!

282
00:23:05,505 --> 00:23:15,505
