1
00:00:02,902 --> 00:00:04,028
Okay, I checked.

2
00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:07,900
We have Earl Grey, English Breakfast,
Cinnamon Stick...

3
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:11,871
...Chamomile, Mint Medley,
Blackberry and

4
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:14,807
Wait, there's one more.
Lemon Soother!

5
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:20,015
You're not the guy that asked
for tea, are you?

The One Where The Monkey Gets Away

7
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,632
Mail call!
Rachel Greene, bunk seven.

8
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:16,468
Thank you.

9
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:20,942
Oh, cool!
A free sample of coffee.

10
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:25,049
Oh, good. Because where else
would we get any?

11
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,582
Oh, right.

12
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:31,589
-Oh, great.
-What is it?

13
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,622
Country club newsletter.

14
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:38,661
My mother sends me the engagement
notices for inspiration.

15
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,365
Oh, my God! It's Barry and Mindy!

16
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:45,467
Barry, who you almost

17
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:47,264
And Mindy, your maid of

18
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:50,032
Let me see. That's Mindy?

19
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,470
She is pretty!

20
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,040
Lucky...

21
00:01:56,616 --> 00:02:00,211
...to have had a friend like you.

22
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,545
Now it's quiet time.

23
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:12,029
Marcel, bring me the rice. Come on.

24
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:13,994
Good boy. Give me the rice.

25
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:15,928
Thank you. Good boy.

26
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:21,468
He's mastered the difference between
"bring me the" and "pee in the."

27
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,810
"Bring me the" and
Rach?

28
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,540
Oh, I'm sorry.

29
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,179
This is so stupid!

30
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,580
I mean, I gave Barry up, right?

31
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:37,847
I should be happy for them.

32
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:39,752
I am. I'm happy for them.

33
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:42,793
-Really?
-No.

34
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:46,990
I guess it would be different
if I were with somebody.

35
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,565
Whoa, what....

36
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:54,034
What happened to "Forget
relationships! I'm done with men!"

37
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,073
The whole penis embargo?

38
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:02,640
I don't know.

39
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:07,080
It's not about no guys.
It's about the right guy.

40
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:11,517
With Barry it was safe and easy,
but there was no heat.

41
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:15,125
With Paolo, all there was, was heat.

42
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:19,992
-lt was this raw, animal, sexual
-Right. I got it.

43
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,061
I was there.

44
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,197
Do you think you can have both?

45
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:30,172
Someone who's your best friend
but also can make your toes curl.

46
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,469
Yes.

47
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:35,204
Yes, I do. I really do.

48
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,750
In fact, it's funny.

49
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:40,920
Often, someone
you wouldn't think could...

50
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,385
...curl your toes...

51
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,956
... might just be the one who...

52
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:48,792
...gets interrupted.

53
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,654
How was the movie?

54
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:52,558
-Wonderful!
-So good!

55
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:55,700
-Suck fest.
-Total chick flick.

56
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:02,434
I'm sorry it wasn't one of those
movies with guns and bombs...

57
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,872
...and buses going really fast!

58
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:09,807
I don't need violence
in a movie...

59
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,745
...as long as
there's a little nudity.

60
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:16,510
-There was nudity.
-I meant female nudity.

61
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:20,090
I don't need to see
Lou Grant frolicking.

62
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:22,227
Hugh! Hugh Grant!

63
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:26,288
All right, I've got to go.

64
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:27,932
Come on, Marcel.

65
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:31,934
We're gonna go take a bath.
Yes, we are, aren't we?

66
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:35,431
They're still just friends, right?

67
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,805
And I will see you tomorrow.

68
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,072
You're gonna spend
tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's.

69
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,117
Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?

70
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,187
Please, Aunt Monica, please?

71
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:53,688
Unclench. You're not even
gonna be here.

72
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:05,103
-I can't believe we're discussing this.
-I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.

73
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:09,130
If it was gonna happen,
wouldn't it have happened already?

74
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:13,969
She said she wants a relationship
with someone exactly like me.

75
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:15,475
She said that?

76
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:19,014
I added the exactly like me" part.

77
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:23,879
But she's looking for someone.
And someone will be there tonight.

78
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:25,388
"Tonight" tonight?

79
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:28,456
It's perfect.
It'll just be the two of us.

80
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:32,290
She spent all day
taking care of my monkey.

81
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:38,363
I can't remember the last time
a girl took care of my monkey.

82
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:46,335
Anyway, I figured after work,
I'd pick up some wine...

83
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:50,243
...go over there and try to woo her.

84
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,342
Know what you should do?

85
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:57,853
Take her back to the 1 890s
when that phrase was last used.

86
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:05,757
If you keep this up, you'll be
finished by the weekend.

87
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,259
The one in the feathered boa
is Dr. Francis.

88
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,834
Now, she used to be a man.

89
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:13,903
Look, there's Raven.

90
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:17,508
We hate her. We're glad she's dying.

91
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,176
And then
What? Marcel!

92
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:24,549
Are you playing with Monica's shoes?
You're not supposed to

93
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:30,289
Marcel, did you poo in the shoe?

94
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,254
Oh, Marcel! Bad monkey!

95
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,422
Oh, God!

96
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:42,533
Sorry, Barry.

97
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:45,128
A little engagement gift.

98
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:48,306
I'm sure you didn't
register for that.

99
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:58,212
Who died? Who died?

100
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,148
Roll him over!
Come on, roll him over!

101
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:06,454
Well, we know it wasn't Dexter,
right, Marcel? Because

102
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:07,648
Marcel?

103
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:14,131
-How could you lose him?
-I don't know!

104
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,736
We were watching TV,
he pooped in Monica's shoe....

105
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,872
Wait. He pooped in my shoe?
Which one?

106
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:23,974
I don't know. The left one!

107
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:25,235
Which ones?

108
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:29,779
Those little clunky Amish things
you think go with everything.

109
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:36,649
Why is the air in here so negative?

110
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,319
Rachel lost Marcel.

111
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:40,581
Oh, no! How?

112
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,819
-He pooped in my shoe.
-Which one?

113
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:45,326
The cute black ones I always wear.

114
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,690
No, which one?

115
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,334
The right or left?

116
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:52,897
Because the left one is lucky.

117
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,902
Come on!
What am I gonna do?

118
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:58,669
All right. You're a monkey.
You're loose in the city.

119
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,879
Where do you go?

120
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:05,081
It's his first time out,
so he'll do touristy things.

121
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:11,954
I'll go to Cats.
You go to the Russian Tea Room.

122
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:15,187
Oh, my God!
Come on, you guys!

123
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:17,919
He'll be home any minute.
He's gonna kill me!

124
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:22,362
Search the building. Take the first
floor. We'll take the rest.

125
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:23,967
What am I gonna do?

126
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,671
You stay here
and wait by the phone.

127
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:30,468
Spray Lysol in my shoe
and wait for Ross to kill you.

128
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,042
Does anybody want to trade?

129
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,786
What do you want?

130
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:45,355
Mr. Heckles, have you seen a monkey?

131
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:48,959
I left a Belgian waffle out here.
Did you take it?

132
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:53,498
-Why'd you leave it in the hall?
-I wasn't ready for it.

133
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,991
Have you seen a monkey?

134
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,000
I saw Regis Philbin once.

135
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:01,871
Thank you, Mr. Heckles.

136
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,704
You owe me a waffle.

137
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:10,006
He's a black capuchin monkey
with a white face...

138
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:15,277
...with Russian dressing
and pickles on the side.

139
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:16,647
Thanks.

140
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:19,823
How did it go today?

141
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:22,927
Oh, great!
It went great. Really great.

142
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:24,493
Is that wine?

143
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,755
You want some?

144
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:28,695
Oh, I would love some.

145
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:31,267
But let's not drink it here.

146
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:35,201
I'm feeling crazy.
You wanna go to Newark?

147
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:44,515
Okay, but before we head off to
the murder capital of the Northeast...

148
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:48,012
... I kind of wanted
to run something by you.

149
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,847
You know how we
were talking before...

150
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:53,890
...about relationships, and stuff.

151
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:58,496
-Oh, God, Ross, I cannot do this!
-Okay, quick and painful.

152
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:08,199
Oh, God!

153
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:11,600
Okay, all right.
All right, okay.

154
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,836
Please don't hate me.

155
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:15,035
What?

156
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,781
You know Marcel?

157
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:26,781
I kind of lost him.

158
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,337
I can't believe this.

159
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,738
All I asked you to do was
keep him in here!

160
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,107
I know. I'm sorry.

161
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,215
It's partially my fault.

162
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:54,182
I shouldn't have had you
start with a monkey.

163
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:57,345
You should have started
with a pencil.

164
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:02,458
I'm doing everything I can.
Everyone's looking for him and I got

165
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,593
-Who is it?
-Animal Control.

166
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:11,860
-I've even got Animal Control.
-You called Animal Control?

167
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:16,537
Why? Do you not like them?

168
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:23,209
Marcel is an illegal exotic animal.

169
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:31,415
I'm not allowed to have him. If they
find him, they'll take him away.

170
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:34,923
Well, now, see,
you never ever told us that.

171
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:39,858
Because I never expected you
to invite them to the apartment!

172
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:46,570
Thanks for coming.

173
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,933
Somebody called about a monkey?

174
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:52,633
You know, that was
a complete misunderstanding.

175
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:55,473
We thought we had a monkey,
but we didn't.

176
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,582
-Turned out it was a hat.
-Cat!

177
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:02,481
We checked, no one's seen Marcel.

178
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:07,022
-My uncle Marcel.
-ls that who the monkey's named after?

179
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:10,953
Possession of an illegal exotic
is punishable...

180
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,657
... by two years in prison
and confiscation of the animal.

181
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:15,823
Oh, my God!

182
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:19,968
You'd put that poor
little creature in jail?

183
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:29,776
Remember how we talked about saying
things quietly to yourself first?

184
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:33,509
Yes, but there isn't always time.

185
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:40,655
I'm sure there's some friendly way
to reconcile this. Have a seat.

186
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,328
We haven't met. I'm Monica Geller.

187
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:46,222
Oh, my God, you are!

188
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,126
And you're Rachel Greene!

189
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:52,463
Luisa Gianetti! Lincoln High?

190
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:56,038
I sat behind you guys in homeroom.

191
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:59,973
Luisa! Oh, my God!

192
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:02,238
Monica! It's Luisa!

193
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:06,317
I went there too!

194
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,510
Luisa! From homeroom!

195
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,387
You have no idea who I am, do you?

196
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:15,184
-No.
-Not at all.

197
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:20,124
Well, maybe that's because
you spent four years ignoring me.

198
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:24,098
Would it have been hard to say,
"Morning, Luisa"...

199
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,669
...or "Nice overalls"?

200
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,802
Oh, I'm so sorry!

201
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:37,346
It's not so much you. You were fat.
You had your own problems.

202
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,513
But you. What a bitch!

203
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:44,651
What?

204
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:47,291
You know what? Be that as it may...

205
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:51,589
...could you help us with the
monkey thing, for old times'sake?

206
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:53,765
Go, Bobcats!

207
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:57,301
I could. But I won't.

208
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,768
If I find that monkey, he's mine.

209
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:07,845
Sorry.

210
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:12,241
Marcel?

211
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:13,976
Marcel?

212
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,359
Hi, can I help you?

213
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:32,698
We're having an emergency,
and we were looking for something.

214
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:36,568
-A monkey.
-Yes, have you seen any?

215
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:39,209
No, I haven't seen a monkey.

216
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:41,379
Can you fix radiators?

217
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,981
Sure! Did you try turning the knob
back the other way?

218
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:48,185
-Of course!
-Oh. Then, no.

219
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:56,327
-Taste this. Is there too much rum?
-Just a second.

220
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:59,088
-Hope you find your monkey.
-No, wait!

221
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,034
We may not know about radiators...

222
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:08,239
... but we do have expertise
in the heating and cooling milieu.

223
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:14,177
Aren't we in the middle of something?

224
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:18,214
But these women are very hot,
and they need our help.

225
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:21,215
And they're very hot!

226
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:24,922
We can't, all right?

227
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:26,589
We're sorry.

228
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:30,727
You don't know how sorry.
We promised to find this monkey.

229
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,058
He's this high
and answers to the name Marcel.

230
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:38,600
So if we could get pictures of you,
it'd help us out.

231
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:50,376
From now on, you don't get
to talk to other people.

232
00:15:58,824 --> 00:15:59,950
-Oh, my God!
-What?

233
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,151
Something brushed up
against my right leg.

234
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:07,189
Oh, it's okay.
It was just my left leg.

235
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:09,756
Look, Phoebe!

236
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,561
Oh, Marcel! Come here!

237
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,329
Step aside, ladies.

238
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:19,102
-What are you gonna do?
-Just a tranquilizer.

239
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,858
Run, Marcel, run!

240
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,185
Damn!

241
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:41,763
-Are you okay?
-I think so.

242
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:51,198
Oh, gosh!

243
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:06,555
We've been all over the neighborhood!
He's just gone!

244
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,887
-You don't know that.
-It's cold, it's dark.

245
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:12,359
He doesn't know the Village!

246
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:17,501
And now I have a broken foot.
I have no monkey and a broken foot!

247
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:18,998
Thank you very much!

248
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,002
I've said I'm sorry a million times.

249
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:23,934
What do you want me to do?

250
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:28,110
You want me to break my foot too?
I'll break it right now.

251
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:31,771
Oh, my God!
There, are you happy now?

252
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:35,750
Yeah, now that you kicked the sign...

253
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:39,446
... I don't miss Marcel anymore!

254
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:43,455
It's not like
I did this on purpose.

255
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:45,755
No, this is just vintage Rachel.

256
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:48,795
Things just sort of happen around you!

257
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:52,698
You're off in "Rachel Land,"
doing your "Rachel Thing"...

258
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:57,239
...oblivious to people's monkeys
or to people's feelings and

259
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:00,603
I don't want to hear it!
Forget it, okay?

260
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,673
What?

261
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:08,879
Hey, banana man!

262
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:16,192
This is so intense!

263
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:21,423
One side of my butt is totally asleep
and the other side has no idea.

264
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:27,938
-What's with Phoebe?
-Tranquilizer dart.

265
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:31,806
Hi! Did you order some bananas?

266
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:34,468
-What about it?
-Give me my monkey back!

267
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:38,046
-I don't have a monkey.
-Then what's with the bananas?

268
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,275
Potassium.

269
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,954
Okay, where is he?

270
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,857
You're wasting your time.

271
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:53,758
What?

272
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:06,733
-What have you done to him?
-That's my monkey. That's Patty.

273
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,476
Are you insane? Come here, Marcel.

274
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:13,711
Come here, Patty.

275
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,409
Come here, Marcel.

276
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:16,979
Come here, Patty.

277
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,987
Here, monkey.

278
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,516
Here, monkey!

279
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,489
Gotcha!

280
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,723
-Give me my monkey back!
-It's mine.

281
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,922
Take this up with the judge.

282
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:32,695
That's not my monkey. The dress
is mine. Send it back whenever.

283
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,805
All right, I want my monkey!

284
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,999
-Oh, come on, Luisa.
-Sorry, prom queen.

285
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:41,441
You had to be a bitch in school,
instead of fat.

286
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:46,115
In high school, I was prom queen...

287
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:49,980
...and the homecoming queen and you...

288
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,054
...were also there.

289
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:56,918
But this isn't high school.
We're all adults here!

290
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,993
Heckles! Can I have this?

291
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:02,324
For the most part.

292
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:07,062
If you take this monkey, I'll lose
an important person in my life.

293
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:11,402
You can hate me if you want,
but please do not punish him.

294
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,807
You have a chance
to be the bigger person here.

295
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:16,844
Take it!

296
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,009
No.

297
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,248
All right. Then I'll call
your supervisor and tell her...

298
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:29,292
...you shot my friend with a dart!

299
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:39,332
It'll be nice to get this off,
won't it?

300
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:42,507
Or we can leave it on. That's fine.

301
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:47,042
With the right pumps,
that would be a great little outfit.

302
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:54,916
Listen, I'm sorry I was so hard
on you before

303
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,248
No, it was my fault.
I almost lost your

304
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:02,154
Yeah, but you got him back.
You were great.

305
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:10,193
We still have that bottle of wine.

306
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:14,303
Are you in the mood
for something grape?

307
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:17,770
-Sure, that would be good.
-All right.

308
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:31,049
The neighbors must be vacuuming.

309
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:40,821
Well, as long as we're here...

310
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,332
...and not on the subject....

311
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,935
I was thinking about...

312
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:53,301
... how mad we got
at each other before.

313
00:21:57,082 --> 00:22:00,449
And maybe it was partially
because of how we

314
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:02,917
-Rachel?
-Barry?

315
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:07,715
I can't do it.
I can't marry Mindy.

316
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:10,451
I think I'm still in love with you.

317
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:19,402
We have got to start
locking that door!

318
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:28,743
Show us! Come on!

319
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:32,883
-lt was such a long time ago.
-Okay, fine. All right.

320
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:37,249
This is me in The Sound of Music.
See the von Trapp kids?

321
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:40,353
That's because I'm in front of them.

322
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,388
Big nun!

323
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,425
I thought that was an alp.

324
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:47,827
High school wasn't
my favorite time.

325
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,194
I loved high school.

326
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:54,202
It was four years of parties,
dating and sex and

327
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:57,807
Well, I went to boarding school
with 400 boys.

328
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:02,376
Any sex I had would've involved
a major lifestyle choice.

329
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:07,481
Doesn't it seem like
a million years ago?

330
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:14,682
My butt cheek is waking up!

331
00:23:15,682 --> 00:23:25,682
