1
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:06,365
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Phoebe.

2
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:08,903
- How did it go?
- Not so good.

3
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:12,306
He walked me home and said,
"Let's do this again."

4
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:16,238
He said, "Let's do this again."
That's good, right?

5
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:21,716
Translated, "Let's do this again"
means, "You'll never see me naked."

6
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:24,151
Since when?

7
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:27,754
Since always.
It's, like, dating language.

8
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:31,124
Like, "It's not you"
means, "It is you."

9
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:36,228
"You're nice" means, "I'll be
dating alcoholics..

10
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:38,666
and complaining
about them to you."

11
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:42,030
"We should see
other people" means:

12
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:43,902
"Ha-ha, I already am!"

13
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:46,810
Everybody knows this?

14
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:48,973
Cushions the blow.

15
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:51,377
Like your parents
putting the dog to sleep..

16
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:53,983
and saying it went to a farm.

17
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:57,281
That's funny. Because our
parents actually did..

18
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:01,323
send our dog off to live on a farm.

19
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:03,094
Ross?

20
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:07,361
Hello! The Milner's farm
in Connecticut?

21
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,967
The Milners had this
unbelievable farm.

22
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,730
They had horses and
rabbits to chase.

23
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:14,372
And it was..

24
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:19,708
Oh, my God! Chi-Chi!

25
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:24,950
The One With the Thumb

26
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:15,700
How does it feel knowing
you're about to die?

27
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:19,201
Warden, in five minutes
my pain will be over.

28
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:24,240
But you'll live with the knowledge
that you sent an honest man to die.

29
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,675
That was really good!

30
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,542
Thanks. Let's keep going.

31
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:33,742
So, what do you want
from me, Dimon? Huh?

32
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:40,216
I just wanna go back to my cell,
because in my cell I can smoke.

33
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:42,451
Smoke away!

34
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,776
I think this is why Dimon
smokes in his cell alone.

35
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,972
- What?
- Relax your hand.

36
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,979
Let your wrist go.

37
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,811
Not so much!

38
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,519
All right. Now take a puff.

39
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,547
Right.

40
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,821
- Give it to me.
- I'm not giving you a cigarette.

41
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,932
It's fine. Do you want to
get this part or not? Here.

42
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:24,126
Now, don't think
of it as a cigarette.

43
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:28,603
Think of it as the thing that
has been missing from your hand.

44
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:31,303
When you hold it,
you feel right.

45
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:32,904
You feel complete.

46
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,175
- You miss it?
- No, not so much.

47
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,510
All right. Now we smoke.

48
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:45,647
Oh, my God!

49
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:47,892
- Give me that!
- No. You've got options.

50
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:49,686
You can smoke like this:

51
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,126
- Chandler
- Or hold it in your mouth.

52
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:53,731
Give me the cigarette!

53
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:55,423
- You try.
- Thank you.

54
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:57,830
Okay, how's this?

55
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,636
Okay, that's not bad.

56
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:06,972
All right, when you're finished,
it's cool if you flick it.

57
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:11,944
All right, you keep practicing..

58
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:14,881
and I'll go put out the sofa.

59
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,955
I thought it was foot size.

60
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,994
No. It's the distance
from the tip of a guy's thumb..

61
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:28,031
to the tip of his index finger.

62
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:35,140
That's ridiculous.

63
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,842
Can I use either thumb?

64
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,876
I'd rather go with the foot theory.

65
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:45,175
All right. Don't tell me.

66
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:49,084
Decaf cappuccino for Joey.

67
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,454
Coffee, black.

68
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:55,556
Latte.

69
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:57,994
And an iced tea.

70
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:01,691
- I'm getting good at this.
- Excellent!

71
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,232
Good for me!

72
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,711
- You okay, Phoebe?
- It's not worth

73
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,409
It's my bank.

74
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:23,885
- What did they do?
- It's nothing

75
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,719
I get my mail and
open their monthly "statement."

76
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:29,622
Easy!

77
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:34,161
And there's $500 extra in my account.

78
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:37,964
Satan's minions at work again!

79
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:40,739
Now I have to go deal with them

80
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,933
- What are you talking about? Keep it!
- It's not mine.

81
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:46,975
If I kept it, I'd be stealing.

82
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,741
But if you spent it,
it would be like shopping.

83
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:55,379
Say I bought a great pair of shoes.

84
00:05:55,588 --> 00:06:00,548
Know what I'd hear with every step?
"Not mine. Not mine. Not mine."

85
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,025
Even if I was happy
and skipping, I'd hear:

86
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,960
"Not-not mine. Not-not mine."

87
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,827
We're with you. We got it.

88
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:14,130
I'd never be able to enjoy it.
It'd be this giant karmic debt.

89
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,399
Chandler, what are you doing?

90
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:19,002
What are you doing?

91
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:24,044
Oh, gross!

92
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,875
- What is this?
- I'm smoking!

93
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:29,611
You've been so good for three years!

94
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:32,916
And this is my reward.

95
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,923
Think about what you went
through when you quit.

96
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:40,691
Forget about you. Think about
what we went through!

97
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,130
So this time I won't quit.

98
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:45,804
- Put it out!
- I'm putting it out!

99
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,404
Oh, no!

100
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:51,008
I can't drink this now.

101
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:57,040
I'm gonna go. I've got a date.

102
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,718
With Alan again?
How's it going?

103
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,049
It's going pretty good.
It's nice and we're having fun.

104
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,122
When do we get to meet him?

105
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:08,190
Let's see, it's Monday..

106
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:10,055
- Never.
- Come on!

107
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,390
Not after what happened with Steve.

108
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:17,092
What do you mean?
We love Steve. Steve was sexy!

109
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,162
Sorry.

110
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:24,434
I don't know how I feel yet.
Let me figure it out.

111
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:26,475
Then can we meet him?

112
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:27,668
No.

113
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,507
Sorry.

114
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,115
Joey. Let it go.

115
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,122
Why should they meet him?

116
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:43,256
I bring a guy home and they're like..

117
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:47,232
coyotes picking off the weak
members of the herd.

118
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:52,337
Listen, as someone who's seen
more than her share of bad beef..

119
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:56,338
I'll tell you,
that is not such a terrible thing.

120
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:59,033
Your friends are just
looking after you.

121
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:02,578
I wish that once I'd date a guy
they liked.

122
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:06,377
You realize the odds of that
happening are slimmer..

123
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:10,147
- if they never get to meet the guy.
- I know.

124
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:13,621
- Can't I whimper a little bit?
- Whimper.

125
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:17,428
Okay, I'm done.

126
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,059
Let it go, Ross.

127
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,563
You didn't know Chi-Chi.

128
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:29,404
- Do you all promise?
- We promise.

129
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:30,633
We'll be good.

130
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:34,244
Chandler, do you promise to be good?

131
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:45,752
You can come in, but your
filter-tip buddy stays outside!

132
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:58,495
"Dear Ms. Buffay.
Thank you for calling.

133
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:02,936
We've credited you $500.
We're sorry for the inconvenience..

134
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:06,134
and hope you'll accept
this football phone..

135
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:11,476
as our gift."
Do you believe it?

136
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:14,847
Now I have $ 1000
and a football phone.

137
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:19,515
What bank is this?

138
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,250
Okay, it's him.

139
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:24,623
- Who is it?
- Alan.

140
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,559
Chandler! He's here!

141
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:30,727
Do I look okay?

142
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:32,870
One more button.

143
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,937
Closed! How about closed?

144
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:38,067
- I didn't know.
- Yeah.

145
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:41,107
Please be good.

146
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:44,112
Remember how much you all like me?

147
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:50,088
Alan, this is everybody.
Everybody, this is Alan.

148
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:57,325
I've heard so much about
all you guys.

149
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,833
I'll call you tomorrow. Thanks.

150
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:13,839
Let's let the Alan-bashing begin.

151
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,674
Who's gonna take the first shot?

152
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,080
Come on!

153
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,817
I'll go.

154
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:26,389
Let's start with how he
kept picking

155
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:29,891
I'm sorry, I can't do this.
We loved him.

156
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,961
We loved him!

157
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:35,895
Wait! We're talking about someone
I'm going out with?

158
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:37,569
That pimento trick!

159
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:41,069
I'll never look at an olive
the same way again.

160
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:42,763
And did you notice?

161
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,939
Know what was great?
His smile was crooked.

162
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:55,086
- Yes! Like the man in the shoe!
- What shoe?

163
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:57,888
From the rhyme.

164
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,955
There was a man
With a crooked smile

165
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,686
Who lived in a shoe
For a while

166
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:08,496
So I think Alan..

167
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:12,865
is the yardstick by which
future boyfriends will be measured.

168
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:14,266
Future boyfriends?

169
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:17,738
- I think this could be "it."
- Really?

170
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:21,811
I'd marry him for his
David Hasselhoff impression alone.

171
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,881
You know I'll be doing that
at parties.

172
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:31,048
- Know what I like most?
- What?

173
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:35,124
The way he makes me feel about myself.

174
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,375
How was the game?

175
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:01,052
Well..

176
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:03,778
We won!

177
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,454
Fantastic! Question.
How is that possible?

178
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,758
- Alan.
- He was unbelievable!

179
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:14,660
Like the cartoon where
Bugs Bunny plays every position.

180
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:19,099
It was first base, Alan.
Second base, Alan..

181
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:25,341
It was like he made us into a team.

182
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:30,481
We sure showed those Hasidic jewelers
a thing or two about softball.

183
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,449
Can I ask a question?

184
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:35,984
Do you think Alan is sometimes..

185
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:37,177
What?

186
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:40,017
I don't know. A little too "Alan"?

187
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:43,753
Oh, no. Not possible.
You can never be too "Alan."

188
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:48,764
It's his innate "Alan-ness"
that we adore.

189
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:51,960
I, personally, could have
a gallon of Alan.

190
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:01,936
- Hey, Lizzy.
- Hey, weird girl.

191
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:05,283
- I brought alphabet soup.
- Pick out the vowels?

192
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:08,453
I left in the Y's.
Because, "sometimes Y."

193
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,188
- And something else.
- Saltines?

194
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:14,723
No, $1000 and a football phone.

195
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:16,724
What?

196
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,391
Oh, my God!

197
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:22,328
- There's really money in here.
- I know.

198
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,230
What are you doing?

199
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:28,065
I want you to have it.
I don't want it.

200
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:31,368
- I have to give you something.
- No, you don't

201
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:35,172
- Do you want my tinfoil hat?
- No, you need that.

202
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:38,111
- It's okay. Thanks.
- Let me do something.

203
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:43,611
I'll tell you what. Buy me
a soda and we're even. Okay?

204
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,352
- Okay.
- Okay.

205
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:49,777
Keep the change.

206
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,013
Thanks, Lizzy.

207
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,383
Want a pretzel?

208
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:55,559
- No, I'm fine. Thanks.
- See you.

209
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:05,866
A thumb?

210
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:10,166
I know. There it was,
just floating..

211
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:13,868
like this tiny little hitchhiker.

212
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:18,774
Maybe it's a contest.
Like "collect all five."

213
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:22,852
- Does anyone wanna see?
- No, thanks!

214
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,349
Don't do that. Come on!

215
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:29,220
It's worse than the thumb.

216
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:33,260
- This is so unfair.
- Why is it unfair?

217
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:36,263
So I have a flaw! Big deal!

218
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:39,096
Joey's knuckle-cracking
isn't annoying?

219
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:41,466
Ross, over-pronouncing every word.

220
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:47,271
Monica, who snorts when she laughs.
I mean, what the hell is that thing?

221
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:52,684
I accept those flaws.
Why can't you accept me for this?

222
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:02,955
Does the knuckle-cracking
bother everybody, or just him?

223
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:07,628
I could live without it.

224
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:15,702
Is it a little annoying? Or is it like
when Phoebe chews her hair?

225
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:21,205
Don't listen to him.
I think it's endearing.

226
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:23,643
Oh, you do, do you?

227
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:32,983
There's nothing wrong with
speaking correctly.

228
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,952
Indeed there isn't.

229
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,892
I should get back to work.

230
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:43,762
Otherwise someone might
get what they ordered.

231
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:50,034
The hair comes out
and the gloves come off.

232
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:08,089
Ever go out with a guy
your friends really like?

233
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,022
No.

234
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:15,663
I'm going out with a guy
my friends really like.

235
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,894
Are we talking about the coyotes here?

236
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:22,904
All right! A cow got through.

237
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:24,904
Can you believe it?

238
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,771
It's just, you know what?

239
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,777
I just don't feel the "thing."

240
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:32,610
They feel the thing. I don't feel it.

241
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:37,619
Honey, you should always
feel the thing.

242
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:43,660
If that's how you feel about the guy,
dump him.

243
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:47,298
- It's gonna be really hard.
- He'll get over it.

244
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:52,527
No, he'll be fine. It's the other five
I'm worried about.

245
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:56,866
- Don't you respect your body?
- Don't you see what you're doing?

246
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:01,012
I've had it with your cancer,
emphysema and heart disease.

247
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:05,611
The bottom line is, smoking is cool,
and you know it.

248
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:10,951
Alan wants to speak to you.

249
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:13,351
Really? He does?

250
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:17,023
Hey, buddy! What's up?

251
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,455
She told you about that, huh?

252
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:25,496
Well, yeah. I have one now and then.
Well, yeah, now.

253
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:28,305
It's not that

254
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:32,176
Well, that's true.

255
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:38,711
Gee, you know, no one's ever put it
like that before.

256
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:41,511
Well, okay. Thanks.

257
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,491
God, he's good.

258
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:57,829
- If only he were a woman.
- Yeah.

259
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,269
Lamb Chop!

260
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:07,673
How old is that sock?

261
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,280
If I had a sock on my hand
for 30 years, it'd be talking too.

262
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:18,748
I think it's time to change somebody's
nicotine patch.

263
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:25,092
- Where's Joey?
- Joey ate my last stick of gum..

264
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:27,390
so I killed him.

265
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,960
Do you think that was wrong?

266
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,268
- I think he's across the hall.
- Thanks.

267
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,867
There you go.

268
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:40,110
I'm alive with pleasure now.

269
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:44,078
Phoebe, do you want
the rest of that Pop-Tart?

270
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:48,151
Does anyone want
the rest of this Pop-Tart?

271
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:51,452
Hey, I might.

272
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:53,882
I'm sorry.

273
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:58,552
The soda people gave me $7000
for the thumb.

274
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:03,163
And on my way over here
I stepped in gum.

275
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:06,065
What is up with the universe?

276
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:10,367
- What's going on?
- It's just nice when we're together.

277
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:14,068
It's nicer when everyone
gets to wear underwear.

278
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:26,483
Please, guys, we have to talk.

279
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:29,422
Wait! I'm getting a deja vu.

280
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:30,754
No, I'm not.

281
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:36,501
- We have to talk.
- There it is!

282
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:41,001
Okay, it's about Alan.

283
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:45,666
Speaking of which, tell him
we're on for the Renaissance Fair.

284
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:50,210
Before you get into that,
there's something you should know.

285
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:54,650
There's really no easy way
to say this.

286
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:59,219
I've decided to break up with Alan.

287
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:05,490
Is there somebody else?

288
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:09,299
No, it's just..

289
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:12,436
you know, things change.
People change.

290
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:15,004
We didn't change.

291
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:20,370
So that's it? It's over?

292
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:22,905
Just like that?

293
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:29,180
You let your guard down. You start
to care about someone, and..

294
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:34,485
- I can go on pretending
- Okay!

295
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:35,751
No.

296
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:39,089
That wouldn't be fair to me, Alan,
or to you.

297
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,289
Well, who wants fair?

298
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,698
I just want things back, you know,
the way they were.

299
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:51,871
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, she's sorry. I feel better.

300
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,669
I can't believe this!

301
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,943
With the holidays coming up.
I wanted him to meet my family.

302
00:22:00,786 --> 00:22:03,687
I'll meet someone.
There'll be other Alans.

303
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:05,049
Yeah, right!

304
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:13,456
- Are you guys gonna be okay?
- We'll be fine.

305
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,259
We're just gonna need a little time.

306
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:19,397
I understand.

307
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:26,544
- Wow.
- I'm really sorry.

308
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:29,873
Yeah, I mean, I'm sorry too.

309
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:33,415
- But I'm a little relieved.
- Relieved?

310
00:22:33,618 --> 00:22:37,281
Yeah, well, I mean,
I had a great time with you.

311
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:40,724
I just can't stand your friends.

312
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:50,331
Remember when we went to Central Park
and rented boats?

313
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,165
That was fun.

314
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:58,142
He could row like a Viking.

315
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:08,884
So how'd it go?

316
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,117
You know.

317
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:13,723
Did he mention us?

318
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,926
He says he's really gonna
miss you guys.

319
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:29,664
- Rough day, huh?
- You have no idea.

320
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:31,775
Come here.

321
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,305
- That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
- No!

322
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:39,814
I don't care! I'm weak!

323
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:41,918
I've gotta have the smoke!

324
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,817
If you never smoke again,
I'll give you $7000.

325
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:47,855
Yeah, all right.
