1
00:00:07,416 --> 00:00:10,055
This is unbelievable!
It's been half an hour.

2
00:00:10,256 --> 00:00:13,612
If this was a cartoon,
you'd look like a ham about now.

3
00:00:13,816 --> 00:00:15,647
There's the waitress.
Excuse me!

4
00:00:15,856 --> 00:00:18,211
-Hello, miss?
-It's Phoebe!

5
00:00:21,176 --> 00:00:22,655
Okay, will that be all?

6
00:00:23,496 --> 00:00:25,691
Wait, wait.
What are you doing here?

7
00:00:26,056 --> 00:00:27,125
I was over there. . .

8
00:00:27,376 --> 00:00:29,890
. . .then you said, ''Excuse me, miss. ''
So now I'm here.

9
00:00:30,616 --> 00:00:32,766
How come you're working here?

10
00:00:33,096 --> 00:00:36,930
Because it's close to where I live,
and the aprons are really cute.

11
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:38,451
Can we start over?

12
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:41,011
Okay, great.
I'm gonna be over here.

13
00:00:41,576 --> 00:00:43,373
The One With the Two Parts - Part I

14
00:00:44,656 --> 00:00:45,645
English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

15
00:01:29,136 --> 00:01:31,889
I don't know if he's testing me
or just acting out. . .

16
00:01:32,096 --> 00:01:34,610
. . .but my monkey is out of control!

17
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:39,613
He keeps erasing
the messages on my machine.

18
00:01:39,856 --> 00:01:42,006
Supposedly by accident.

19
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,248
Yeah, I've done that.

20
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:50,852
And three days in a row, he got
to the newspaper before I did. . .

21
00:01:51,096 --> 00:01:53,212
. . .and peed all over the crossword!

22
00:01:53,816 --> 00:01:55,727
I've never done that.

23
00:01:56,856 --> 00:01:59,734
Now tell me she doesn't look
exactly like her sister.

24
00:02:00,256 --> 00:02:02,247
I'm saying I see a difference.

25
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:03,605
They're twins.

26
00:02:03,856 --> 00:02:07,246
I don't care.
Phoebe's Phoebe. Ursula's hot.

27
00:02:08,776 --> 00:02:11,415
You know that thing
when we talk about things?

28
00:02:11,656 --> 00:02:13,408
Let's not do that anymore.

29
00:02:16,376 --> 00:02:18,446
Hey, Pheebs.
Guess who we saw today?

30
00:02:19,096 --> 00:02:20,245
Oh, fun!

31
00:02:20,776 --> 00:02:22,050
-Liam Neeson.
-No.

32
00:02:22,256 --> 00:02:23,655
Morley Safer.

33
00:02:23,896 --> 00:02:25,454
The woman who cuts my hair!

34
00:02:25,696 --> 00:02:27,652
This could be a really long game.

35
00:02:27,896 --> 00:02:29,045
Your sister, Ursula.

36
00:02:29,456 --> 00:02:30,650
Oh, really?

37
00:02:30,976 --> 00:02:32,534
She works at that place. . . .

38
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:33,805
Riff's. Yeah, I know.

39
00:02:34,056 --> 00:02:36,695
You do? She said you guys
haven't talked in years.

40
00:02:40,576 --> 00:02:42,806
So is she fat?

41
00:02:44,896 --> 00:02:47,012
Not from where I was standing.

42
00:02:47,576 --> 00:02:48,929
Where were you standing?

43
00:02:51,656 --> 00:02:54,614
Pheebs, so you guys
just don't get along?

44
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:57,610
It's mostly just dumb
sister stuff, you know?

45
00:02:57,856 --> 00:03:00,893
Everyone always thought of her
as the pretty one.

46
00:03:02,696 --> 00:03:04,334
She was the first to walk. . .

47
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:07,329
. . .even though I did it
later that same day.

48
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:12,605
To my parents, by then it was,
''Yeah, what else is new?''

49
00:03:14,256 --> 00:03:17,054
I'm sorry. I've gotta go.
I've got Lamaze class.

50
00:03:17,256 --> 00:03:20,407
And I've got earth science,
but I'll catch you in gym?

51
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:25,407
Is this just gonna be you and Carol?

52
00:03:25,656 --> 00:03:27,248
Susan will be there too.

53
00:03:27,496 --> 00:03:31,614
We've got dads, we've got lesbians.
The whole parenting team.

54
00:03:32,256 --> 00:03:33,894
Isn't that gonna be weird?

55
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:36,133
It might have been at first. . .

56
00:03:36,376 --> 00:03:38,810
. . .but now I'm comfortable
with the situation.

57
00:03:39,056 --> 00:03:39,966
That's my jacket.

58
00:03:40,176 --> 00:03:41,211
I know.

59
00:03:49,976 --> 00:03:51,204
We're the Rostens.

60
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:54,055
I'm J.C. and he's Michael.

61
00:03:54,296 --> 00:03:57,174
And we're having a boy and a girl.

62
00:03:58,096 --> 00:04:00,405
Good for you!
Alrighty, next?

63
00:04:04,096 --> 00:04:05,415
I'm Ross Geller.

64
00:04:05,776 --> 00:04:07,846
And that's my boy in there.

65
00:04:08,096 --> 00:04:12,612
And this is Carol Willick,
and this is Susan Bunch.

66
00:04:13,976 --> 00:04:16,615
Susan is Carol's. . . .

67
00:04:21,816 --> 00:04:23,010
Who's next?

68
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,284
Sorry, Susan is. . .?

69
00:04:26,496 --> 00:04:28,566
-Susan is Carol's friend.
-Life partner.

70
00:04:28,776 --> 00:04:30,414
Like buddies.

71
00:04:31,136 --> 00:04:32,012
Like lovers.

72
00:04:32,496 --> 00:04:34,612
You know how close women can get.

73
00:04:36,096 --> 00:04:38,246
-Susan and I live together.
-I was married to her.

74
00:04:38,456 --> 00:04:41,050
-Carol, not me.
-It's a little complicated.

75
00:04:41,256 --> 00:04:42,575
-But we're fine.
-Absolutely.

76
00:04:44,496 --> 00:04:45,815
So, twins!

77
00:04:46,096 --> 00:04:47,324
That's like two birds.

78
00:04:57,976 --> 00:04:59,614
--to you too, Helen!

79
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,850
Nina Bookbinder is here to see you.

80
00:05:03,096 --> 00:05:05,007
Okay, send her in.

81
00:05:10,616 --> 00:05:13,414
-Come on in.
-You wanted to see me?

82
00:05:13,736 --> 00:05:15,454
I was just going over your data.

83
00:05:15,656 --> 00:05:18,011
You've been postdating
your Friday numbers.

84
00:05:18,296 --> 00:05:20,173
Which is bad, because. . .?

85
00:05:20,376 --> 00:05:22,173
It throws my WENUS out of whack.

86
00:05:23,496 --> 00:05:24,292
Excuse me?

87
00:05:24,976 --> 00:05:26,125
WENUS.

88
00:05:26,376 --> 00:05:28,446
Weekly Estimated
Net Usage Statistics.

89
00:05:28,656 --> 00:05:30,453
Right. Gotcha, gotcha.

90
00:05:30,656 --> 00:05:34,410
Won't happen again. I wouldn't
want to do anything to hurt your. . .

91
00:05:34,616 --> 00:05:35,685
. . .WENUS.

92
00:05:45,976 --> 00:05:49,013
It's not just that she's cute, okay?
It's just that. . .

93
00:05:49,256 --> 00:05:51,406
. . .she's really, really cute.

94
00:05:51,856 --> 00:05:55,815
It doesn't matter. You don't dip
your pen in the company ink.

95
00:05:58,656 --> 00:05:59,611
Ross.

96
00:05:59,896 --> 00:06:02,205
Your little creature's
got the remote again.

97
00:06:03,456 --> 00:06:05,890
Marcel, give Rossy the remote.

98
00:06:07,296 --> 00:06:08,285
Marcel!

99
00:06:09,576 --> 00:06:12,613
Marcel, you give Rossy
the remote right now!

100
00:06:16,096 --> 00:06:18,052
You give Rossy the remote--

101
00:06:18,616 --> 00:06:21,005
-Great.
-Relax. I'll fix it.

102
00:06:23,256 --> 00:06:24,086
Oh, cool.

103
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:25,246
Urkel. . .

104
00:06:25,496 --> 00:06:28,010
. . .in Spanish is Urkel.

105
00:06:30,096 --> 00:06:32,007
How did he do this?

106
00:06:33,016 --> 00:06:35,166
Is leaving the Christmas lights up. . .

107
00:06:35,376 --> 00:06:37,844
. . .your plan to keep us
merry all year long?

108
00:06:38,056 --> 00:06:41,128
Someone was supposed to take
them down around New Year's. . .

109
00:06:41,376 --> 00:06:43,048
. . .but obviously someone forgot!

110
00:06:43,656 --> 00:06:45,851
Someone was supposed to write:

111
00:06:46,056 --> 00:06:49,810
''Rach, take down the lights''
and put it on the refrigera--

112
00:06:52,016 --> 00:06:53,813
How long has that been there?

113
00:06:55,496 --> 00:06:56,292
Where you been?

114
00:06:56,856 --> 00:07:00,246
Riff's. I think Ursula likes me.
All I ordered was coffee.

115
00:07:00,496 --> 00:07:04,011
She brought me a tuna melt
and four plates of curly fries.

116
00:07:06,056 --> 00:07:07,205
Score.

117
00:07:08,816 --> 00:07:11,205
She is so hot!

118
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,850
Okay, before you do
anything Joey-like. . .

119
00:07:14,096 --> 00:07:16,246
. . .you might want to run it by. . . .

120
00:07:19,176 --> 00:07:20,165
Pheebs?

121
00:07:21,456 --> 00:07:23,731
Would it be okay
if I asked out your sister?

122
00:07:24,096 --> 00:07:27,008
Why? Why would you
want to do that? Why?

123
00:07:28,216 --> 00:07:31,094
So that if we went out on a date,
she'd be there.

124
00:07:36,296 --> 00:07:39,129
Well, I mean, I'm not
my sister's, you know. . .

125
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:40,604
. . .whatever.

126
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:45,408
And I mean, it's true,
we were one egg once.

127
00:07:46,016 --> 00:07:48,610
But, you know,
we've grown apart, so. . . .

128
00:07:48,856 --> 00:07:50,494
I don't know. Why not?

129
00:07:50,856 --> 00:07:52,050
Cool. Thanks.

130
00:07:55,616 --> 00:07:56,731
You okay?

131
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,409
Yeah, I'm fine.

132
00:07:59,096 --> 00:08:01,610
Do you wanna watch
Laverne y Shirley?

133
00:08:16,376 --> 00:08:17,411
Sorry.

134
00:08:19,096 --> 00:08:21,246
Sorry I'm late.
Where's Carol?

135
00:08:21,496 --> 00:08:24,533
Stuck at school.
Some parent-teacher thing.

136
00:08:24,776 --> 00:08:27,290
You can go.
I'll get the information.

137
00:08:28,096 --> 00:08:32,487
No, I think I should stay.
We should both know what's going on.

138
00:08:32,696 --> 00:08:33,845
Oh, good.

139
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,449
This will be fun.

140
00:08:35,656 --> 00:08:39,968
We're gonna start with some basic
third-stage breathing exercises.

141
00:08:40,176 --> 00:08:41,848
Mommies, get on your back.

142
00:08:42,096 --> 00:08:45,805
And, coaches, you should be
supporting Mommy's head.

143
00:08:52,496 --> 00:08:53,451
-What?
-What?

144
00:08:53,696 --> 00:08:55,334
I'm supposed to be the mommy?

145
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:58,812
Okay, I'm gonna play
my sperm card one more time.

146
00:09:00,616 --> 00:09:04,291
I have to miss out on the coaching
training because I'm a woman?

147
00:09:04,496 --> 00:09:06,214
So what do you propose to do?

148
00:09:06,456 --> 00:09:08,606
-I'll flip you for it.
-Flip me for it?

149
00:09:08,816 --> 00:09:10,295
Heads, heads, heads!

150
00:09:10,896 --> 00:09:12,852
On your back, Mom!

151
00:09:16,696 --> 00:09:20,609
All right, Mommies, take
a nice, deep, cleansing breath.

152
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:24,892
Good.

153
00:09:25,096 --> 00:09:27,894
Now imagine your vagina is opening. . .

154
00:09:28,096 --> 00:09:30,007
. . .like a flower.

155
00:09:40,296 --> 00:09:42,287
Mr. Dee! How's it going, sir?

156
00:09:42,496 --> 00:09:43,724
It's been better.

157
00:09:44,296 --> 00:09:46,685
The Annual Net Usage
Statistics are in.

158
00:09:48,016 --> 00:09:49,415
It's pretty ugly.

159
00:09:49,616 --> 00:09:52,813
We haven't seen an ANUS
this bad since the '70s.

160
00:09:54,096 --> 00:09:54,926
What's it mean?

161
00:09:55,496 --> 00:09:57,532
We'll be laying off people.

162
00:09:57,976 --> 00:10:01,571
I know I was late last week.
I slept funny and my hair was snarly.

163
00:10:01,776 --> 00:10:03,004
Not you.

164
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:04,815
Relax.

165
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,414
Ever have to fire anyone?

166
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:10,886
Nina. . . .

167
00:10:13,016 --> 00:10:14,051
Nina.

168
00:10:20,936 --> 00:10:21,766
Are you okay?

169
00:10:23,496 --> 00:10:25,293
Yes. Yes, I am.

170
00:10:26,896 --> 00:10:30,605
Listen, the reason that
I called you in here today was. . . .

171
00:10:31,216 --> 00:10:32,615
Please don't hate me.

172
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:34,212
What?

173
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:38,566
Would you like
to have dinner sometime?

174
00:10:43,616 --> 00:10:46,005
So, what do you want
for your birthday?

175
00:10:46,496 --> 00:10:50,535
What I really want is for my mom
to be alive and enjoy it with me.

176
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:59,408
Let me put it this way.
Anything from Crabtree & Evelyn?

177
00:10:59,616 --> 00:11:01,254
Bath salts would be nice!

178
00:11:01,496 --> 00:11:02,406
Good.

179
00:11:10,816 --> 00:11:12,249
What is this place?

180
00:11:12,496 --> 00:11:15,056
You're cold, I have to pee,
and there's coffee.

181
00:11:15,256 --> 00:11:17,008
How bad could it be?

182
00:11:17,296 --> 00:11:19,207
I think we have an answer.

183
00:11:20,856 --> 00:11:22,005
What's she doing here?

184
00:11:22,256 --> 00:11:25,407
This could be God's way
of telling us to eat at home.

185
00:11:26,016 --> 00:11:29,770
-Think she got fired at Riff's?
-No, we were there last night.

186
00:11:29,976 --> 00:11:32,536
She kept bringing swordfish.
Are you gonna go. . .?

187
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:34,846
I'll wait until we order.
It's her, right?

188
00:11:35,096 --> 00:11:37,451
It looks like her.

189
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:39,408
Excuse me?

190
00:11:40,096 --> 00:11:41,495
Hi, it's us!

191
00:11:45,376 --> 00:11:47,207
Right. And it's me!

192
00:11:49,496 --> 00:11:51,088
So you're here too?

193
00:11:51,576 --> 00:11:53,214
As much as you are.

194
00:11:53,696 --> 00:11:54,811
Your turn.

195
00:11:55,976 --> 00:11:56,931
We know what we want.

196
00:11:57,296 --> 00:11:58,206
That's good.

197
00:11:59,376 --> 00:12:01,844
-Two caffe lattes.
-And some biscotti cookies.

198
00:12:02,376 --> 00:12:03,604
Good choice.

199
00:12:07,696 --> 00:12:09,209
It's definitely her.

200
00:12:18,736 --> 00:12:19,851
I can't believe you.

201
00:12:20,096 --> 00:12:23,054
You still haven't told that girl
she doesn't have a job?

202
00:12:23,856 --> 00:12:26,609
You still haven't taken down
the Christmas lights.

203
00:12:27,696 --> 00:12:31,132
Congratulations! I think you found
the world's thinnest argument.

204
00:12:31,776 --> 00:12:33,653
Trying to find the right moment.

205
00:12:33,896 --> 00:12:36,808
That shouldn't be so hard,
now that you're dating.

206
00:12:38,176 --> 00:12:42,328
''Sweetheart, you're fired. But how
about a quickie before I go to work?''

207
00:12:49,696 --> 00:12:52,813
Once you're inside,
you don't have to knock anymore.

208
00:12:54,056 --> 00:12:55,409
I'll get it.

209
00:12:58,656 --> 00:13:00,408
Hi, Mr. Heckles.

210
00:13:00,976 --> 00:13:01,965
You're doing it again.

211
00:13:02,176 --> 00:13:03,609
We're not doing anything.

212
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:06,808
We're just sitting around
talking quietly.

213
00:13:07,096 --> 00:13:09,007
I can hear you through the ceiling.

214
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:12,812
My cats can't sleep.

215
00:13:14,456 --> 00:13:16,094
You don't even have cats.

216
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,127
I could have cats.

217
00:13:19,616 --> 00:13:20,765
Goodbye, Mr. Heckles.

218
00:13:20,976 --> 00:13:23,410
We'll try to keep it down.

219
00:13:27,496 --> 00:13:30,010
Phoebe, can you do me a favor?

220
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:32,173
Try this on to make sure it fits.

221
00:13:32,376 --> 00:13:36,130
My first birthday present!
Oh, this is really--

222
00:13:36,376 --> 00:13:39,448
It's for Ursula.
I just figured, you know, size-wise.

223
00:13:42,296 --> 00:13:43,570
Sure. Yeah.

224
00:13:43,776 --> 00:13:45,095
Okay, it fits.

225
00:13:47,376 --> 00:13:48,525
Are you seeing her again?

226
00:13:48,736 --> 00:13:50,852
Yep, Ice Capades.

227
00:13:51,296 --> 00:13:52,251
This is serious.

228
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:55,607
I've never known you to pay money
for any kind of ''capade. ''

229
00:13:57,776 --> 00:13:59,448
I don't know. I like her.

230
00:13:59,696 --> 00:14:02,893
She's different.
There's something about her--

231
00:14:03,096 --> 00:14:05,291
That you like.
We get it. You like her.

232
00:14:07,176 --> 00:14:09,644
Phoebe, I asked you
and you said it was okay.

233
00:14:09,856 --> 00:14:11,687
Well, maybe now it's not okay.

234
00:14:13,976 --> 00:14:17,207
Well, maybe now I'm not okay
with it not being okay.

235
00:14:22,656 --> 00:14:24,248
Knit, good woman.
Knit! Knit!

236
00:14:37,096 --> 00:14:39,815
And that's the Chrysler Building
right there.

237
00:14:41,496 --> 00:14:43,009
Mr. Douglas.

238
00:14:43,496 --> 00:14:44,485
Cool tie.

239
00:14:47,896 --> 00:14:48,806
She's still here.

240
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:51,606
Yes. Yes, she is.

241
00:14:52,096 --> 00:14:53,324
Didn't I memo you?

242
00:14:53,576 --> 00:14:58,252
After I let her go, I got a call
from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen. . .

243
00:14:58,496 --> 00:14:59,975
. . .Dr. Flanan, Dr. Flan.

244
00:15:02,256 --> 00:15:05,214
And he informed me that
she took the news rather badly.

245
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:08,055
In fact, he mentioned
the word ''frenzy. ''

246
00:15:08,976 --> 00:15:10,250
She seems so. . . .

247
00:15:10,456 --> 00:15:12,208
Oh, no, no.
Nina? She's. . . .

248
00:15:14,176 --> 00:15:16,212
In fact, if you asked her now. . .

249
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,214
. . .she'd have no recollection
of being fired at all.

250
00:15:20,456 --> 00:15:21,571
That's unbelievable.

251
00:15:21,776 --> 00:15:23,368
And yet believable.

252
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,012
So I decided not to fire her again. . .

253
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:29,447
. . .until I'm sure she will be
of no threat to herself or others.

254
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:34,414
I see. You never really know what's
going on inside a person's head.

255
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:38,412
Well, I guess that's why
they call it psychology, sir.

256
00:15:41,056 --> 00:15:44,014
The sound Mom and Dad
will never forget.

257
00:15:44,216 --> 00:15:47,333
For this, after all,
is the miracle of birth.

258
00:15:47,576 --> 00:15:48,804
Lights, please.

259
00:15:49,056 --> 00:15:50,455
And that's having a baby.

260
00:15:50,696 --> 00:15:52,812
Next week is our final class.

261
00:15:54,296 --> 00:15:55,809
Susan, go deep.

262
00:16:00,576 --> 00:16:02,806
It's impossible.
It's just impossible.

263
00:16:03,016 --> 00:16:04,051
What is, honey?

264
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,048
What that woman. . .

265
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,245
. . .did.

266
00:16:08,256 --> 00:16:10,816
I am not doing that!

267
00:16:11,056 --> 00:16:14,048
It'll have to stay in, that's all.
Everything will be the same.

268
00:16:14,296 --> 00:16:17,174
-It'll just stay in.
-Carol, honey.

269
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,936
-Everything will be all right.
-What do you know?

270
00:16:20,136 --> 00:16:22,855
No one's saying to you,
''Hi, is that your nostril?

271
00:16:23,096 --> 00:16:25,485
Mind if we push
this pot roast through it?! ''

272
00:16:26,696 --> 00:16:28,209
Carol, sweetie.

273
00:16:28,456 --> 00:16:29,809
Cleansing breath.

274
00:16:31,096 --> 00:16:34,054
I know it's frightening.
But big picture:

275
00:16:34,296 --> 00:16:36,571
The birth part is just one day. . .

276
00:16:36,976 --> 00:16:40,969
. . .and when it's over, we'll all
be parents for the rest of our lives.

277
00:16:41,576 --> 00:16:44,010
I mean, that's what
this is all about, right?

278
00:16:44,256 --> 00:16:45,245
Ross?

279
00:16:46,536 --> 00:16:47,332
Ross.

280
00:16:48,096 --> 00:16:49,973
I'm gonna be a father.

281
00:16:51,096 --> 00:16:54,247
-This is just occurring to you?
-I knew I was having a baby.

282
00:16:54,456 --> 00:16:57,607
I just never realized
the baby was having me.

283
00:16:58,016 --> 00:16:59,847
You're gonna be great.

284
00:17:00,096 --> 00:17:01,415
How could you say that?

285
00:17:01,616 --> 00:17:04,608
I can't even get Marcel
to stop eating the bathmat.

286
00:17:05,296 --> 00:17:06,615
How will I raise a kid?

287
00:17:07,096 --> 00:17:09,246
You know, some scientists
are now saying. . .

288
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:12,408
. . .that monkeys and babies
are actually different.

289
00:17:15,656 --> 00:17:16,805
-Where are you going?
-Out.

290
00:17:17,056 --> 00:17:18,409
With. . .?

291
00:17:20,496 --> 00:17:22,134
Can I just ask you one question?

292
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:26,409
Have you two, you know,
like, you know?

293
00:17:27,976 --> 00:17:29,011
You know?

294
00:17:29,976 --> 00:17:30,931
Yet?

295
00:17:31,776 --> 00:17:33,653
Not that it's any
of your business. . .

296
00:17:33,896 --> 00:17:35,534
. . .but no, we haven't.

297
00:17:41,016 --> 00:17:43,007
You meant sex, right?

298
00:17:51,176 --> 00:17:53,849
-Do you have a sec?
-Sure, Nina. What's up?

299
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:57,488
For the past few days,
people have been avoiding me. . .

300
00:17:57,696 --> 00:17:59,573
. . .and giving me strange looks.

301
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:04,011
Oh, well, maybe that's because. . .

302
00:18:04,256 --> 00:18:05,735
. . .they're jealous of us.

303
00:18:06,096 --> 00:18:07,370
Maybe.

304
00:18:07,576 --> 00:18:10,613
But that doesn't explain why
they keep taking my scissors.

305
00:18:11,496 --> 00:18:15,171
Well, maybe that's because
you're getting a big raise!

306
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:18,487
-I am?
-Sure. Why not?

307
00:18:18,776 --> 00:18:21,609
Oh, my God!
You're amazing!

308
00:18:22,176 --> 00:18:24,007
Oh, you don't know.

309
00:18:24,856 --> 00:18:28,132
Helen, make sure we do the paperwork
on Miss Bookbinder's raise.

310
00:18:28,656 --> 00:18:32,615
You still want me to send her
psychological profile to personnel?

311
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,209
Helen drinks.

312
00:18:35,896 --> 00:18:37,614
Will you marry me?

313
00:18:43,936 --> 00:18:46,655
-I ended up telling her everything.
-How'd she take it?

314
00:18:47,056 --> 00:18:49,809
Pretty well.
Except for the stapler thing.

315
00:18:50,216 --> 00:18:53,174
Little tip. If you're ever
in a similar situation. . .

316
00:18:53,376 --> 00:18:56,015
. . .never, ever leave
your hand on the desk.

317
00:18:57,176 --> 00:19:00,009
Okay, I think I get how to do this.

318
00:19:05,096 --> 00:19:07,610
Can we turn this off?
Can we make them go away?

319
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:09,608
Because I can't watch.

320
00:19:09,976 --> 00:19:10,806
They're gone.

321
00:19:12,336 --> 00:19:13,974
Are you all right?

322
00:19:14,176 --> 00:19:17,930
Yeah. It's just this whole
stupid Ursula thing.

323
00:19:18,296 --> 00:19:19,649
Okay, can I ask. . .?

324
00:19:19,896 --> 00:19:23,013
So he's going out with her.
Is it really so terrible?

325
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:24,526
Yeah.

326
00:19:26,216 --> 00:19:29,253
I mean, I'm not saying
she's evil or anything.

327
00:19:29,496 --> 00:19:32,215
She's just, you know,
always breaking my stuff.

328
00:19:33,096 --> 00:19:36,247
When I was 8, I wouldn't let her
have my Judy Jetson thermos. . .

329
00:19:36,456 --> 00:19:38,412
. . .so she threw it under the bus.

330
00:19:39,296 --> 00:19:41,014
And then there's Randy Brown. . .

331
00:19:41,216 --> 00:19:42,615
. . .who was like. . . .

332
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:45,854
Have you ever had a boyfriend
who was your best friend?

333
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:51,851
Well, but that's what he was for me.

334
00:19:52,056 --> 00:19:54,445
And she, you know,
kind of stole him away. . .

335
00:19:54,696 --> 00:19:57,415
. . .and then broke his heart.

336
00:19:58,216 --> 00:20:00,730
And then he wouldn't
even talk to me anymore.

337
00:20:00,976 --> 00:20:05,049
He didn't want to be around anything
that looked like either one of us.

338
00:20:08,816 --> 00:20:12,809
I mean, I know Joey's not
my boyfriend or my thermos. . .

339
00:20:13,856 --> 00:20:15,209
. . .or anything, but. . . .

340
00:20:15,456 --> 00:20:18,095
-You won't lose him.
-You gotta talk to Joey.

341
00:20:18,696 --> 00:20:19,572
Yeah, okay.

342
00:20:19,776 --> 00:20:22,768
He doesn't know this stuff.
If he knew how you felt. . . .

343
00:20:22,976 --> 00:20:24,534
He's falling in love with her.

344
00:20:24,736 --> 00:20:26,647
They've been going out a week.

345
00:20:26,896 --> 00:20:31,014
They haven't even slept together yet.
I mean, that's not serious.

346
00:20:57,376 --> 00:20:58,809
May we help you?

347
00:21:13,656 --> 00:21:16,853
What are you doing? It's freezing!
Would you come inside?

348
00:21:17,056 --> 00:21:18,808
No, no, no.

349
00:21:19,016 --> 00:21:21,610
You wanted me to take them down. . .

350
00:21:21,816 --> 00:21:24,284
. . .so I'm taking them down, okay?

351
00:21:27,896 --> 00:21:28,726
Rachel!

352
00:21:28,976 --> 00:21:31,012
I'm okay. I'm okay.

353
00:21:32,096 --> 00:21:33,290
Mr. Heckles?

354
00:21:34,176 --> 00:21:36,815
Mr. Heckles,
could you help me, please?

355
00:21:37,936 --> 00:21:41,008
This is just the kind of thing
I was talking about.
