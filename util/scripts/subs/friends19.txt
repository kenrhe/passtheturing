1
00:00:02,435 --> 00:00:05,268
I can't believe
you'd actually say that.

2
00:00:05,505 --> 00:00:08,804
I'd much rather be Mr. Peanut
than Mr. Salty.

3
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:11,770
No way.
Mr. Salty is a sailor.

4
00:00:11,978 --> 00:00:14,776
He's gotta be
the toughest snack there is.

5
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:19,808
I don't know. You don't
wanna mess with Cornnuts.

6
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:21,878
They're crazy.

7
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:26,491
Oh, my God. You gotta come see this.

8
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:30,060
There's some creep out there
with a telescope.

9
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:34,192
I can't believe it.
He's looking right at us.

10
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:36,332
Oh, that is so sick.

11
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:38,196
I feel violated.

12
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:40,200
And not in a good way.

13
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:42,898
How can people do that?

14
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:48,510
You guys, look.
Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots.

15
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,313
The One With the Evil Orthodontist

16
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:42,157
Years from now,
school children will study it...

17
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:45,394
...as one of the greatest
first dates ever.

18
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:48,006
-Yeah.
-I'll say, yeah.

19
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:49,834
It was unbelievable.

20
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:53,170
We could be ourselves.
We didn't have to play games.

21
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:57,372
-Have you called her?
-She'd know I like her. That's crazy.

22
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:58,812
Guys. It's gross.

23
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:01,816
It's the next day.
How needy do I wanna seem?

24
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:04,990
-I'm right. Right?
-Yeah, let her dangle.

25
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:11,593
I can't believe my parents are
pushing me to find one of you people.

26
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,164
Come on. Just do it.

27
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:17,734
Call her.
Stop being so testosterone-y.

28
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:23,308
Which, by the way,
is the real San Francisco treat.

29
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,571
-Her machine.
-Answering machine?

30
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:33,410
No, interestingly,
her leaf blower picked up.

31
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:37,918
So, why didn't you say anything?

32
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:41,217
No. Last time I left
a spontaneous message...

33
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:45,056
... I ended up using the phrase,
"Yes, indeed-io."

34
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:49,394
Look, it's Rachel and Barry.
Don't everybody look.

35
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,560
What's going on?

36
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:54,831
-They're just talking.
-Does he look upset?

37
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:58,510
Does he look like he was told
to shove anything?

38
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:02,111
No. Actually, he's smiling.

39
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:04,509
Oh, my God. Don't do that.

40
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:05,683
What? What? What?

41
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:09,651
That man across the street
just kicked that pigeon.

42
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:16,695
And basically, that's how
a bill becomes a law.

43
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,897
See? Hey, Rach.

44
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:23,363
How'd it go?

45
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,533
You know, it was actually
really great.

46
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,501
Lunch at the Russian Tea Room.

47
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,645
I had that chicken, where you poke it
and butter squirts out.

48
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:35,609
Not a good day for birds.

49
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,578
Then we went to Bendel's.

50
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:41,548
And I told him not to, but he got me
a bottle of Chanel.

51
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:46,088
That's nice. Now was that before
or after you told him...

52
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:50,922
...to stop calling, stop sending
flowers and to leave you alone?

53
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:55,066
Right. Well, we never actually
got to that.

54
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:58,236
It was just so nice to see him again.

55
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:01,999
It was comfortable
and it was familiar.

56
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:03,841
It was just nice.

57
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,907
That's nice twice.

58
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,307
Isn't this the same Barry
who you left at the altar?

59
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,151
Where have you been?

60
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:17,122
It was different
with him today.

61
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:20,087
He wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy.

62
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:24,922
I mean, we had fun.
Is there anything wrong with that?

63
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,100
-Why?
-I have my reasons.

64
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,096
He's engaged to another woman...

65
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:38,209
...who happens to be
your ex-best friend?

66
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,976
All right.
I know it's stupid.

67
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,445
I'll see him this afternoon
and put an end to it.

68
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:55,116
I'm not crazy, right?
I mean, it was never like that.

69
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,391
No, it wasn't.

70
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,795
It was so nice
having this little sink here.

71
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:14,143
Then with authority, hang up.

72
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:17,806
Will you just leave her the message?

73
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:19,985
Okay. All right, fine.

74
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,250
"Oh, Danielle,
I wasn't expecting the machine.

75
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:30,854
Give me a call
when you get a chance.

76
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:34,793
Bye-bye.

77
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:36,862
Oh, God.

78
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,372
That's what you've been working on
for two hours?

79
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:44,840
Hey, I've been honing.

80
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:50,012
-What was with the dishes?
-She might think I'm in a restaurant.

81
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:54,379
I might have a life.
Like I haven't been sitting here...

82
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,815
... honing for the last two hours?

83
00:05:57,123 --> 00:06:01,355
-The telescope guy's doing it again.
-Oh, my God.

84
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:06,896
Go away.
Stop looking in here.

85
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,533
Great.
Now he's waving back.

86
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,629
We gotta do something.

87
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:17,968
I caught him looking into our place.
I feel like I can't do stuff.

88
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,709
What kind of stuff?

89
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:26,148
Will you grow up?
I'm not talking about sexy stuff...

90
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:29,446
...but, like,
when I'm cooking naked.

91
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:32,051
You cook naked?

92
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:35,726
Yeah, toast, oatmeal.
Nothing that spatters.

93
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:42,627
What are you looking at me for?
I didn't know that.

94
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,503
What's the matter?

95
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:48,833
I just
Oh, Barry, this was not good.

96
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:52,010
No, it was.
It was very, very good.

97
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:55,738
-What about Mindy?
-Way better than Mindy.

98
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:00,747
I mean, what about you and Mindy?

99
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:04,354
If you want, I'll
break it off with her.

100
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:08,493
No, don't do that.
Not for me.

101
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:12,288
Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush
is here for his adjustment.

102
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:14,261
Thanks, Bernice.

103
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:16,632
Let's go away this weekend.

104
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,936
-This is all way too
-No, we can go to Aruba.

105
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:25,143
When I went there on what
would've been our honeymoon...

106
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:29,280
...it was really nice.
You would've liked it.

107
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:31,974
I had a bra.

108
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,797
Hey, Dr. Farber.

109
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:48,660
All right, Miss Greene,
everything looks fine.

110
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:51,797
We're starting to see
some real progress.

111
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:58,667
-What?
-I'm 1 2, I'm not stupid.

112
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:10,682
Can I use your phone?

113
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:13,985
For future reference,
that thing in your hand...

114
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:16,423
...can also be used as a phone.

115
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:22,660
Yes, it's working.

116
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:27,402
-Why isn't she calling?
-Maybe she never got your message.

117
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:31,043
Call her machine,
and if she has a lot of beeps...

118
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,405
...that means she didn't get
her messages yet.

119
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:38,707
-Doesn't that make me seem?
-Desperate? Needy? Pathetic?

120
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:41,442
You obviously saw my personal ad.

121
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:45,387
How many beeps?

122
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,115
She answered.

123
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:52,227
This is where you'd use
that "hello" word.

124
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:55,623
I won't talk to her.
She got my message...

125
00:08:55,902 --> 00:09:00,134
...and is choosing not to call me.
Now I'm needy and snubbed.

126
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:03,003
God, I miss just being needy.

127
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,201
So how'd he take it?

128
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,947
Pretty well, actually.

129
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,946
How come you have
dental floss in your hair?

130
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:18,621
Oh, do l?

131
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:26,091
-We ended up having sex in his chair.
-You had sex in his chair?

132
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:34,600
I said that a little
too loudly, didn't l?

133
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:36,499
You had what?

134
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:39,811
Sex in his chair.

135
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:45,284
What...? What were you thinking?

136
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:48,612
I don't know.
We still care about each other.

137
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:51,813
There's a history there.
It's like you and Carol.

138
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,753
It's nothing like me and Carol.

139
00:09:56,963 --> 00:10:00,956
If she said to you,
"Ross, I want you on this couch...

140
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,862
... right here, right now,"
what would you say?

141
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:08,000
If it helps, I could slide over.

142
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:15,110
It's a totally different situation.
It's apples and oranges.

143
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:18,977
It's orthodontists and lesbians
I gotta go.

144
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,920
-Where are you going?
-I just have to go.

145
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:25,318
I have things to do with my life.

146
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:27,822
I have a jam-packed schedule.

147
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:31,622
And I am late for keeping up
with it, okay?

148
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:46,909
Mindy.

149
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,176
How are you?

150
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:54,542
Yes, I heard. Congratulations.
That is so great.

151
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,811
Really, oh, God

152
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:04,388
I'm working tomorrow, but if you
want, you can come by if you'd like.

153
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:07,622
Great.

154
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,266
Great.

155
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,605
So I'll see you tomorrow.

156
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:16,400
Okay. Bye.

157
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,104
Oh, God. Oh, God.

158
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:23,375
So how's Mindy?

159
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:30,582
She wants to see me tomorrow. She
sounded weird. I gotta call Barry.

160
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:36,455
It's me. I just
Mindy.

161
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:41,421
Mindy. No, I figured
that's where you'd be.

162
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:01,314
Hell is filled
with people like you.

163
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:07,187
He's back.
The peeper's back.

164
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,156
-Get down.
-Get down?

165
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:10,788
And boogie.

166
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:16,325
I gotta go and get
my eyes scratched out by Mindy.

167
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:18,160
She may not even know.

168
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:24,000
I haven't heard from her in seven
months, what else is it about?

169
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,235
She was my best friend.

170
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:30,243
We went to camp together,
she taught me how to kiss....

171
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:36,120
Now, you know,
I'm, like, the other woman.

172
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:39,256
-I feel so
-Naughty.

173
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:43,853
-See you later.
-I'll walk with you.

174
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:49,625
When she taught you to kiss, were you
wearing any kind of little uniform?

175
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,197
That's fine, yeah.

176
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:57,772
I'm going to the bathroom.
Will you watch my phone?

177
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:00,912
-Take it with you.
-We haven't had a second date...

178
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:04,605
-...she needs to hear me pee?
-Why don't you call her?

179
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:08,048
I can't. I left a message.
I have some pride.

180
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,222
-Do you?
-No.

181
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:18,085
Danielle, hi.

182
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,265
It's Chandler.

183
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:21,932
I'm fine.

184
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:24,432
Listen....

185
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:28,368
I don't know if you tried
to call me because...

186
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:31,475
... I accidentally shut off my phone.

187
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,579
That's fine. That's great. Okay.

188
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,745
She's on the other line.
She's gonna call me back.

189
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:45,788
She's on the other line,
she's gonna call me back.

190
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:49,993
-Don't you have to pee?
-That's why I'm dancing.

191
00:13:53,732 --> 00:13:55,927
-Mindy.
-Hey, you.

192
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,332
Hey, you.

193
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:03,302
So what's up?

194
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,836
We should really be sitting for this.

195
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,981
Sure we should.

196
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:23,357
I'm gonna ask once,
and I want a straight answer.

197
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:28,329
Not like when I asked if those red
pants made my ass look big.

198
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,902
I know things have been weird...

199
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:34,095
...but you're my oldest friend,
except for Laurie...

200
00:14:34,306 --> 00:14:36,934
...who's bitter because
she lost weight...

201
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:40,043
...and it turns out,
she doesn't have a pretty face.

202
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:43,181
-Okay, I'm just gonna say it.
-Okay.

203
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:48,014
Will you be my maid of honor?

204
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:53,124
-Of course.
-That's so great.

205
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:56,120
It is. It is. It is.

206
00:14:56,495 --> 00:15:00,261
-That's all you wanted to ask?
-That's all.

207
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:05,768
-What?
-That's not all.

208
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:10,431
-Oh, sure it is.
-Oh, no, it isn't.

209
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:15,671
I think Barry's seeing someone
in the city.

210
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,072
What would make you think that?

211
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,318
Since the engagement,
he's acted weird.

212
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:26,388
And then last night, he came home
smelling like Chanel.

213
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:29,484
Really?

214
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,897
If it'll make you feel any better...

215
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:36,566
...when Barry and I got engaged,
he was weird too.

216
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,067
Oh, God.
That's what I was afraid of.

217
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,899
What's what you were afraid of?

218
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:48,142
When Barry was engaged to you,
he and l...

219
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:52,181
... kind of had
a little thing on the side.

220
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:55,247
-What?
-I know, I know.

221
00:15:55,454 --> 00:16:00,517
When he proposed, people said, "He'll
do to you what he did to Rachel."

222
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:03,058
And now I feel so stupid.

223
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:08,832
You are so stupid.

224
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:13,428
We are both so stupid.

225
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,401
What do you mean?

226
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:18,840
Smell familiar?

227
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:23,613
Oh, I'm so sorry.

228
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:26,582
Oh, no, me.
I am so sorry.

229
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:28,810
No, I am sorry.
I'm sorry.

230
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:44,458
Oh, my.

231
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:49,240
Four letters, "circle or hoop."

232
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,341
-Ring, damn it, ring.
-Thanks.

233
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:59,508
-You know our phone's not working?
-What?

234
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:02,846
I called and there was no answer.

235
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:04,647
I turned it off.

236
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,018
Mother of God, I turned it off.

237
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,389
Just like you told her you did.

238
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,598
Just pointing out the irony.

239
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:16,893
I went across the street
to the doorman.

240
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:21,104
I got the peeper's name.
Can I use the phone?

241
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,038
Can I use your phone?

242
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:30,309
The number for a Sidney Marks, please.

243
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:32,776
"Heating device."

244
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:34,683
Radiator.

245
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,081
Five letters.

246
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:37,955
"Rdtor."

247
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:44,422
Yeah, is Sidney there?

248
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:48,495
Oh, this is? Sidney's a woman.

249
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,327
So she's a woman, so what?

250
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,800
Yeah, so what?

251
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:57,165
I live across the street, and I know
about your telescope.

252
00:17:57,609 --> 00:17:59,338
And I don't appreciate it.

253
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:02,341
Yeah, I can see you right now.
Hello?

254
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:07,684
If I wanna walk around in my
underwear, I shouldn't have to feel

255
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:09,547
Thank you.

256
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:15,220
That's not really the point.
The point is, that

257
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,521
Mostly free-weights,
but occasionally

258
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:23,026
Yeah, my neighbor.
Yeah, the brunette.

259
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:28,267
She said you looked pretty that day
in the green dress.

260
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:30,998
The green dress? Really?

261
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,373
She said you looked like
lngrid Bergman.

262
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:41,881
Did she mention me?

263
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:47,523
She wants to know why you tie
the towel around your head.

264
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:51,257
It's a leave-in conditioner, okay?

265
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:54,691
It's a leave-in conditioner.

266
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:01,136
-You got a second?
-Sure, sure.

267
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,432
Come on...

268
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,703
-...in.
-Hello, sweetheart.

269
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:08,341
What you guys doing here?

270
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,344
We are here to break up with you.

271
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:13,744
Both of you?

272
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:19,453
We think you're a horrible person,
and bad things should happen to you.

273
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,020
I'm sorry.
God, I am so sorry.

274
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,628
I was weak.
I couldn't help myself.

275
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:30,062
Whatever I did, I only did
because I love you so much.

276
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:34,804
Which one of us
are you talking to there?

277
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:37,902
Mindy.

278
00:19:38,143 --> 00:19:40,634
Of course, Mindy.
It was always Mindy.

279
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,379
When we were having sex
in that chair?

280
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:47,182
I swear, whatever I was doing,
I was thinking of you.

281
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:52,880
Please. That second time, you couldn't
have picked her out of a lineup.

282
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:54,820
You did it twice?

283
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:59,259
The first time didn't really count.
You know, it was Barry.

284
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:03,729
Honey, sweetheart, look.
Just give me another chance.

285
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:06,769
We'll start over.
We'll go back to Aruba.

286
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:11,966
What is it with you and Aruba?
Do you have a deal with the airlines?

287
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:14,075
What do you say?

288
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:17,008
Dr. Farber, we've got
an emergency here.

289
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:19,910
Jason Castalano 's choking
on his retainer.

290
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:22,983
Oh, God.
I'll be right there, Bernice.

291
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:25,315
Look, please don't go anywhere.

292
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:27,424
I'll be right back.

293
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:31,996
Okay, and we'll be here,
hating you.

294
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:35,925
See how he was sweating
when he walked out?

295
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:39,467
If I'm hogging the ball,
you jump right in there...

296
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:42,299
...and take some punches.
This feels great.

297
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:47,201
I'm pretty sure
I'm still gonna marry him.

298
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:49,640
What are you talking about?

299
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:52,679
Mindy, the guy is the devil.

300
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:54,977
He is Satan in a smock.

301
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:57,621
I know he's not perfect.

302
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:06,287
But the truth is at the end of
the day, I still really wanna be...

303
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:09,796
... Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber...

304
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:12,526
... D. D.S.

305
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:14,399
Oh, God.

306
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:18,472
I hope you can find a way
to be happy for me.

307
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:22,180
And I hope you'll still be
my maid of honor.

308
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:26,645
And I hope Barry doesn't kill you
and eat you in Aruba.

309
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:34,223
You okay?

310
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:38,225
Really?

311
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:43,394
Since I ran out on Barry
at the wedding...

312
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:47,003
...I've wondered whether I made
the right choice.

313
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:48,763
And now I know.

314
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,502
I'm so glad.

315
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:57,272
Big day.

316
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:08,990
I'll give you this:
Mr. Peanut is a better dresser.

317
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:12,196
He's got the monocle,
he's got the top hat....

318
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:14,058
Did you know he's gay?

319
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:21,395
I just wanna clarify this.
Are you outing Mr. Peanut?

320
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:25,543
Danielle, hi.

321
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:28,907
Everybody, this is Danielle.
Danielle, everybody.

322
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:30,841
Why are you here?

323
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:34,211
I've been calling,
but I had your number wrong.

324
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:37,718
When I got the right one,
there was no answer.

325
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:42,393
So I thought I'd come down here
and make sure you were okay.

326
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:43,652
I'm okay.

327
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:46,523
Maybe we could get together later?

328
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:51,366
That sounds good. I'll call you.
Or you call me, whatever.

329
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:52,798
You got it.

330
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,903
-Bye, everybody.
-Bye.

331
00:22:57,576 --> 00:23:00,477
-There you go.
-Second date.

332
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:02,010
I don't know.

333
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:03,773
You don't know?

334
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:07,577
She seems nice, but her coming
all the way here...

335
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:12,415
...just to see if I was okay?
I mean, how needy is that?

336
00:23:13,415 --> 00:23:23,415
