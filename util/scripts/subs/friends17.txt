1
00:00:14,892 --> 00:00:16,803
Rach, we're running low on résumés.

2
00:00:17,452 --> 00:00:19,602
Do you want a job
with Popular Mechanics?

3
00:00:19,852 --> 00:00:23,288
If you must work for mechanics,
those are the ones to work for.

4
00:00:24,172 --> 00:00:26,322
Look, you guys.
I'm going for anything here.

5
00:00:26,572 --> 00:00:28,563
I can't be a waitress anymore.
I mean it.

6
00:00:28,772 --> 00:00:33,084
I'm sick of the lousy tips.
I'm sick of being called ''Excuse Me. ''

7
00:00:33,972 --> 00:00:36,088
Rach, did you proofread these?

8
00:00:37,172 --> 00:00:38,048
Why?

9
00:00:39,132 --> 00:00:43,489
Nothing. I'm sure they'll be
impressed with your ''compuper'' skills!

10
00:00:43,852 --> 00:00:45,570
Oh, my God!

11
00:00:46,732 --> 00:00:48,688
Do you think it's on all of them?

12
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:54,889
No, I'm sure the Xerox machine
caught a few!

13
00:00:56,452 --> 00:00:57,931
The One With the Poker

14
00:00:59,172 --> 00:01:00,161
English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

15
00:01:44,652 --> 00:01:45,767
Hey, guys.

16
00:01:47,372 --> 00:01:48,646
Hi, ladies.

17
00:01:49,372 --> 00:01:51,249
Can I get you anything?

18
00:01:51,452 --> 00:01:53,488
-Did you bring the mail?
-Lots of responses.

19
00:01:53,732 --> 00:01:56,690
Really? Sure we have scones left!

20
00:01:57,332 --> 00:01:58,287
Read them to me.

21
00:01:58,532 --> 00:02:02,844
''Dear Miss Greene: Thank you
for your inquiry. However. . . . ''

22
00:02:03,652 --> 00:02:06,485
-We have apple cinnamon--
-''Dear Miss Greene'' . . . .

23
00:02:12,452 --> 00:02:14,170
Your VISA bill is huge!

24
00:02:15,692 --> 00:02:16,568
Give me that.

25
00:02:16,972 --> 00:02:18,724
I can't believe you.
Linda's great.

26
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,883
-Why won't you date her?
-I don't know.

27
00:02:21,132 --> 00:02:22,360
Is this still about her. . .

28
00:02:22,572 --> 00:02:25,291
. . . ''The Flintstones could
have really happened'' thing?

29
00:02:26,572 --> 00:02:27,687
It's not just that.

30
00:02:27,892 --> 00:02:30,531
It's just, I want someone
who does something for me. . .

31
00:02:30,772 --> 00:02:32,569
. . .who gets my heart pounding. . .

32
00:02:33,492 --> 00:02:35,483
. . .who makes me. . . .

33
00:02:37,252 --> 00:02:39,686
Little play things with yarn?

34
00:02:41,092 --> 00:02:42,127
What?

35
00:02:42,572 --> 00:02:44,722
Could you want her more?

36
00:02:45,572 --> 00:02:46,368
Who?

37
00:02:46,732 --> 00:02:50,042
Who? Dee, the sarcastic sister
from What's Happening!

38
00:02:53,052 --> 00:02:53,848
Who?

39
00:02:57,332 --> 00:02:59,607
Look, I am totally, totally over her.

40
00:02:59,852 --> 00:03:01,285
-I just--
-Coffee?

41
00:03:01,532 --> 00:03:03,887
No, we're fine.
We're fine.

42
00:03:09,052 --> 00:03:09,848
Shut up!

43
00:03:10,052 --> 00:03:12,008
We're not saying anything.

44
00:03:12,252 --> 00:03:13,367
What?

45
00:03:13,572 --> 00:03:15,483
Joey cried last night.

46
00:03:15,972 --> 00:03:17,166
Thank you.

47
00:03:17,972 --> 00:03:19,166
We were playing poker.

48
00:03:19,372 --> 00:03:22,170
There was chocolate on the 3.
It looked like an 8.

49
00:03:23,972 --> 00:03:26,930
God, you should've seen him.
''Read them and weep! ''

50
00:03:27,172 --> 00:03:28,730
And then he did.

51
00:03:30,172 --> 00:03:33,687
Now, how come you guys
have never played poker with us?

52
00:03:33,932 --> 00:03:37,891
What is that? Some guy thing?
Like some kind of sexist guy thing?

53
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:40,811
Like it's poker,
so only guys can play?

54
00:03:41,052 --> 00:03:42,531
Women are welcome to play.

55
00:03:42,772 --> 00:03:46,731
Then what is it? Some kind of, like,
some kind of, you know. . . .

56
00:03:46,972 --> 00:03:48,371
All right, what is it?

57
00:03:50,292 --> 00:03:52,362
There just aren't
any women in our game.

58
00:03:52,572 --> 00:03:56,247
We just don't happen to know any
women that know how to play poker.

59
00:03:56,452 --> 00:04:00,240
Please! That is such a lame excuse.
It's a typical guy response.

60
00:04:00,452 --> 00:04:01,771
Do you know how to play?

61
00:04:02,372 --> 00:04:03,566
No.

62
00:04:05,252 --> 00:04:06,480
But you could teach us.

63
00:04:06,732 --> 00:04:08,085
No.

64
00:04:12,572 --> 00:04:16,281
Okay, so now we draw cards.

65
00:04:19,772 --> 00:04:22,127
I wouldn't need any,
because I have a straight.

66
00:04:22,332 --> 00:04:24,687
-Oh, good for you!
-Congratulations!

67
00:04:27,492 --> 00:04:29,210
Pheebs, how many do you want?

68
00:04:29,892 --> 00:04:34,283
I just need two. The 1 0 of spades
and the 6 of clubs.

69
00:04:35,972 --> 00:04:37,485
Pheebs, you can't do that.

70
00:04:37,732 --> 00:04:39,450
I've got the 1 0 of spades. Here.

71
00:04:39,652 --> 00:04:40,562
Thanks.

72
00:04:42,772 --> 00:04:44,490
See, you can't do that.

73
00:04:44,732 --> 00:04:46,927
I don't need them.
I'm going for 4s.

74
00:04:47,132 --> 00:04:48,201
Oh, you're. . . .

75
00:04:53,892 --> 00:04:54,802
Here we go.

76
00:04:55,052 --> 00:04:58,089
We've got salmon roulettes
and assorted crudités.

77
00:04:58,732 --> 00:04:59,926
What are you doing?

78
00:05:00,172 --> 00:05:03,881
This is a poker game. You can't serve
food with more than one syllable.

79
00:05:04,092 --> 00:05:08,324
It's got to be like chips
or dip or pretz--

80
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,166
At this point, the dealer--

81
00:05:11,372 --> 00:05:14,967
We got it. Let's play for real.
High stakes! Big bucks!

82
00:05:15,172 --> 00:05:17,527
You sure? Phoebe
just threw away two jacks. . .

83
00:05:17,772 --> 00:05:19,524
. . .because they didn't look happy.

84
00:05:23,292 --> 00:05:26,284
But I'm ready. So just deal.

85
00:05:26,532 --> 00:05:29,490
Everybody, last minute
lesson! Joey. . . .

86
00:05:29,692 --> 00:05:30,886
Three. . .

87
00:05:31,172 --> 00:05:32,002
. . .eight!

88
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:34,568
Eight, three. All right!

89
00:05:39,492 --> 00:05:41,448
Damn it, damn it, damn it!

90
00:05:41,932 --> 00:05:44,082
I see. So then you were lying.

91
00:05:44,292 --> 00:05:46,487
-About what?
-About how good your cards were.

92
00:05:47,172 --> 00:05:48,321
I was bluffing.

93
00:05:49,252 --> 00:05:51,402
And what is ''bluffing''?

94
00:05:53,172 --> 00:05:56,289
Is it not another word for lying?

95
00:05:56,772 --> 00:05:58,649
Sorry to break up this party. . .

96
00:05:58,852 --> 00:06:01,650
. . .but I've got résumés to fax
before work tomorrow.

97
00:06:01,852 --> 00:06:03,331
Rach, we've got to settle.

98
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:04,846
Settle what?

99
00:06:05,772 --> 00:06:08,081
The Jamestown colony of Virginia.

100
00:06:09,972 --> 00:06:12,691
You see, King George
is giving us the land, so. . . .

101
00:06:15,612 --> 00:06:18,570
The game, Rachel.
You owe us money for the game.

102
00:06:18,772 --> 00:06:19,568
Oh, right!

103
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:23,248
Guys, it's their first time.
Why don't we forget about the money?

104
00:06:23,452 --> 00:06:25,727
Hell, no! We'll pay.

105
00:06:25,972 --> 00:06:29,487
Okay, Monica, I had
another answer all ready.

106
00:06:30,652 --> 00:06:31,687
And you know what?

107
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,486
-We want a rematch.
-That's fine with me.

108
00:06:34,692 --> 00:06:36,091
Could use the money.

109
00:06:37,532 --> 00:06:41,571
So you get your ya-yas
by taking money from your friends.

110
00:06:43,172 --> 00:06:45,766
And I get my ya-yas from Ikea.

111
00:06:47,772 --> 00:06:50,969
You have to put them together
yourself, but they cost less.

112
00:06:52,252 --> 00:06:54,891
Look, Rachel, this is poker.
I play to win.

113
00:06:55,132 --> 00:06:57,487
In order for me to win,
others have to lose.

114
00:06:57,692 --> 00:07:01,128
If you're gonna play poker with me,
don't expect me to be nice.

115
00:07:01,372 --> 00:07:04,284
Because once those cards
are dealt. . . .

116
00:07:17,572 --> 00:07:19,688
I'm not a nice guy.

117
00:07:26,092 --> 00:07:27,684
All right, boys. Let's eat.

118
00:07:27,892 --> 00:07:31,282
Did you get that from
the ''I Love Rachel'' pizzeria?

119
00:07:32,012 --> 00:07:32,922
Are you still on that?

120
00:07:33,132 --> 00:07:35,692
Come on. What was with that
Black Bart speech?

121
00:07:35,932 --> 00:07:39,083
''When I play poker,
I'm not a nice guy'' !

122
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,166
You're way off, pal.

123
00:07:41,372 --> 00:07:44,842
I don't think so. See, Ross,
because I think you love her!

124
00:07:46,772 --> 00:07:50,082
I might have had feelings for her
at one time. Not anymore.

125
00:07:50,292 --> 00:07:52,852
I just-- Marcel!

126
00:07:53,052 --> 00:07:54,610
Where are you going
with that disk?

127
00:07:54,852 --> 00:07:57,286
You are not putting that on again.

128
00:07:57,492 --> 00:08:01,246
If you press that button,
you are in very, very big trouble.

129
00:08:14,852 --> 00:08:17,446
You believe what a jerk
Ross was being?

130
00:08:17,652 --> 00:08:18,448
Yeah, I know.

131
00:08:18,652 --> 00:08:20,688
He can get really competitive.

132
00:08:23,372 --> 00:08:24,407
What?

133
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:28,284
''Hello, Kettle, this is Monica.
You're black! ''

134
00:08:28,532 --> 00:08:29,885
Please!

135
00:08:32,772 --> 00:08:34,922
I am not as bad as Ross.

136
00:08:35,132 --> 00:08:38,920
I beg to differ.
The Pictionary incident?

137
00:08:39,132 --> 00:08:40,531
That was not an incident.

138
00:08:40,772 --> 00:08:45,084
I was gesturing and the plate
slipped out of my hand.

139
00:08:48,852 --> 00:08:52,162
-I got an interview!
-You're kidding! Where?

140
00:08:52,412 --> 00:08:55,688
Saks Fifth Avenue!

141
00:08:56,972 --> 00:09:00,282
It's like the mother ship
is calling you home.

142
00:09:03,932 --> 00:09:05,001
What's the job?

143
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,089
Assistant buyer!

144
00:09:08,332 --> 00:09:10,288
I would be shopping. . .

145
00:09:11,692 --> 00:09:13,489
. . .for a living!

146
00:09:15,372 --> 00:09:19,081
That's Aunt Iris. This woman's been
playing poker since she was 5.

147
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,647
You've got to listen
to every word she says.

148
00:09:22,692 --> 00:09:25,365
-Is Tony Randall dead?
-I don't think so.

149
00:09:25,612 --> 00:09:27,603
He may be now.
I think I hit him with my car.

150
00:09:28,732 --> 00:09:31,610
-My God! Really?
-No, that's bluffing! Lesson one!

151
00:09:34,052 --> 00:09:35,485
Let me tell you something.

152
00:09:35,692 --> 00:09:38,525
Everything you hear
at a poker game is pure crap!

153
00:09:39,492 --> 00:09:41,483
-Nice earrings.
-Thank you.

154
00:09:44,092 --> 00:09:46,083
Girls, sit down!

155
00:09:46,332 --> 00:09:48,607
Aunt Iris, this is Phoebe,
and that's Rachel--

156
00:09:48,852 --> 00:09:52,128
Listen, I am parked at a meter.
Let's do it.

157
00:10:00,812 --> 00:10:04,043
Ross, could we please, please,
listen to anything else?

158
00:10:04,292 --> 00:10:05,691
All right.

159
00:10:21,332 --> 00:10:23,368
I'm gonna pay for that tonight.

160
00:10:29,452 --> 00:10:31,010
Guys, guess what, guess what?

161
00:10:32,572 --> 00:10:35,803
The fifth dentist caved, and now
they all recommend Trident?

162
00:10:41,652 --> 00:10:43,847
No, the interview!

163
00:10:44,092 --> 00:10:45,684
She loved me.
She absolutely loved me.

164
00:10:45,932 --> 00:10:49,607
We talked for two and a half hours.
We have the same taste in clothes.

165
00:10:50,332 --> 00:10:52,084
And I went to camp with her cousin.

166
00:10:52,332 --> 00:10:55,324
And the job is perfect!
I can do this well!

167
00:10:55,532 --> 00:10:56,601
That's great!

168
00:10:56,852 --> 00:10:58,922
God! And she told
the funniest story.

169
00:10:59,172 --> 00:11:01,049
Great, you'll tell us
and we'll laugh!

170
00:11:01,252 --> 00:11:02,446
Let's play poker!

171
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,010
Listen, we talked about it. . .

172
00:11:06,212 --> 00:11:09,284
. . .and if you don't want to play,
we completely understand.

173
00:11:09,532 --> 00:11:11,682
We can play some other game. Like. . .

174
00:11:11,932 --> 00:11:13,047
. . .Pictionary?

175
00:11:15,292 --> 00:11:16,520
Very funny.

176
00:11:16,772 --> 00:11:19,047
We'd give poker another try.
Shall we, ladies?

177
00:11:19,252 --> 00:11:20,685
Yes, I think we should.

178
00:11:21,172 --> 00:11:22,890
Rach, do you want me
to shuffle those?

179
00:11:23,132 --> 00:11:25,692
That's okay,
I'm gonna give it a go.

180
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:40,325
So Pheebs owes 7.50.
Monica, you owe $ 1 0.00.

181
00:11:40,572 --> 00:11:43,484
And, Rachel, you owe 1 5 big ones!

182
00:11:44,652 --> 00:11:48,361
Thanks for teaching us ''Crossed-eyed
Mary. '' We gotta play that other way.

183
00:11:50,172 --> 00:11:53,960
Here's my 7.50, but you should
know that this money is cursed.

184
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,083
-What?
-I cursed it!

185
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,731
So now bad things will happen
to he who spends it.

186
00:12:01,412 --> 00:12:04,290
I'll take it.
Bad things happen to me anyway.

187
00:12:05,452 --> 00:12:07,807
This way, I can break them up
with a movie.

188
00:12:08,052 --> 00:12:12,967
So that just leaves the big
Greene poker machine, who owes 1 5.

189
00:12:14,092 --> 00:12:15,491
It's so typical:

190
00:12:15,732 --> 00:12:18,087
''I'm a man! I have a penis!

191
00:12:18,292 --> 00:12:21,887
I have to win money
to exert my power over women! ''

192
00:12:25,292 --> 00:12:26,771
You know, this isn't over.

193
00:12:27,052 --> 00:12:30,044
We will play you again.
And we will win and you will lose.

194
00:12:30,252 --> 00:12:31,844
And you will beg and we will laugh.

195
00:12:32,132 --> 00:12:33,724
And we will take
every last dime you have.

196
00:12:33,972 --> 00:12:36,486
And you will
hate yourselves forever!

197
00:12:39,172 --> 00:12:41,891
Kind of stepped on
my point there, Monica!

198
00:12:47,492 --> 00:12:49,289
Wanna hand over your money now?

199
00:12:49,532 --> 00:12:52,649
That way, we don't have to go
through the formality of playing.

200
00:12:53,452 --> 00:12:57,570
No, that's fine. We'll see
who has the last laugh, monkey boy.

201
00:13:00,372 --> 00:13:03,330
Are we done with the chit chat?
Ready for serious poker?

202
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:07,081
You guys, look! The one-eyed Jack
follows me wherever I go.

203
00:13:08,652 --> 00:13:10,529
Right, okay. Serious poker.

204
00:13:11,772 --> 00:13:13,728
Excuse me.
Where are you going?

205
00:13:13,932 --> 00:13:14,808
To the bathroom.

206
00:13:15,332 --> 00:13:17,641
Do you wanna go to the bathroom
or play poker?

207
00:13:17,932 --> 00:13:19,445
I wanna go to the bathroom.

208
00:13:21,652 --> 00:13:23,882
Well, I'm gonna order a pizza.

209
00:13:24,452 --> 00:13:28,365
I'm waiting to hear from that job. The
store closes at 9. You can eat then.

210
00:13:29,172 --> 00:13:33,085
That's fine. I'll just have
a Tic Tac to hold me over.

211
00:13:34,532 --> 00:13:38,161
Cincinnati. No blinds.
Everybody ante.

212
00:13:38,532 --> 00:13:39,328
Yes!

213
00:13:40,572 --> 00:13:41,891
Or no!

214
00:13:45,652 --> 00:13:47,210
Your money's mine, Greene.

215
00:13:47,412 --> 00:13:49,004
Your fly's open, Geller.

216
00:13:54,732 --> 00:13:56,370
You know what I just realized?

217
00:13:57,372 --> 00:14:00,409
''Joker'' is ''poker'' with a ''J'' !

218
00:14:02,732 --> 00:14:04,131
Coincidence?

219
00:14:05,292 --> 00:14:09,080
That's ''joincidence'' with a ''C'' !

220
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:22,290
Yeah, I'm out.

221
00:14:23,252 --> 00:14:24,401
I'm in.

222
00:14:24,772 --> 00:14:25,727
Me too.

223
00:14:25,972 --> 00:14:27,690
Me too.
What do you got?

224
00:14:28,572 --> 00:14:32,929
You better hop out of the shower,
because I got a flush.

225
00:14:35,732 --> 00:14:37,290
Well, well, well!

226
00:14:37,532 --> 00:14:42,083
Hop back in, bucko,
because I got four 6s!

227
00:14:42,292 --> 00:14:45,125
I got four 6s!
I won! I actually won!

228
00:14:45,412 --> 00:14:46,208
Oh, my God!

229
00:14:46,412 --> 00:14:49,370
You know what?
I'm gonna make a little Ross pile.

230
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:55,483
I think that one was Ross' .
And I think that one was Ross' .

231
00:14:56,932 --> 00:15:00,641
Well, I have got your money
And you'll never see it

232
00:15:00,852 --> 00:15:03,002
And your fly's still open

233
00:15:03,212 --> 00:15:05,089
I made you look

234
00:15:07,892 --> 00:15:10,326
-I'm in.
-I couldn't be inner.

235
00:15:10,572 --> 00:15:13,040
Monica, in or out?

236
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,084
I hate this game!

237
00:15:23,012 --> 00:15:24,411
Okay, Joey, your bet.

238
00:15:24,612 --> 00:15:27,729
I fold, like a cheap hooker
who got hit in the stomach. . .

239
00:15:27,972 --> 00:15:30,725
. . .by a fat guy
with sores on his face.

240
00:15:34,172 --> 00:15:35,321
I'm out.

241
00:15:37,572 --> 00:15:39,483
I'm very in.

242
00:15:41,532 --> 00:15:42,567
Couldn't be more out.

243
00:15:42,772 --> 00:15:43,682
Me too.

244
00:15:45,732 --> 00:15:49,327
I will see you and I'll raise you.

245
00:15:49,852 --> 00:15:51,649
Do you wanna waste another buck?

246
00:15:52,572 --> 00:15:53,891
No, not this time.

247
00:15:54,572 --> 00:15:56,403
-What did you have?
-I'm not telling.

248
00:15:56,612 --> 00:15:57,727
Come on, show them.

249
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:01,525
-Get your hands out of there!
-I've had dates like this.

250
00:16:04,732 --> 00:16:07,690
Boy, you really can't stand
to lose, can you?

251
00:16:07,932 --> 00:16:08,887
Your whole face is getting red.

252
00:16:09,132 --> 00:16:12,488
Little veins popping out
of your temple.

253
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:16,369
Plus that shirt doesn't really
match those pants.

254
00:16:20,092 --> 00:16:23,687
-I'm not losing. Just deal the--
-You are definitely losing.

255
00:16:23,932 --> 00:16:24,967
Rachel Greene.

256
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:28,007
Excuse me.

257
00:16:28,292 --> 00:16:29,964
It's about the job!

258
00:16:30,492 --> 00:16:32,767
Barbara, hi! How are you?

259
00:16:37,252 --> 00:16:38,571
No, I understand.

260
00:16:40,972 --> 00:16:44,282
Come on. No, I'm fine.
Don't be silly.

261
00:16:45,132 --> 00:16:48,807
But, you know, if anything else
opens up, please--

262
00:17:07,972 --> 00:17:09,087
Sorry, Rach.

263
00:17:09,492 --> 00:17:11,926
You know, there's gonna be
lots of other stuff.

264
00:17:14,932 --> 00:17:16,285
Where were we?

265
00:17:17,532 --> 00:17:21,445
Five card draw. Jacks are better.

266
00:17:21,652 --> 00:17:23,051
Nothing wild, everybody ante.

267
00:17:23,852 --> 00:17:25,888
Look, Rach,
we don't have to do this.

268
00:17:26,652 --> 00:17:28,085
Yes, we do.

269
00:17:30,692 --> 00:17:32,648
-All right. Check.
-Check.

270
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,326
I'm in for 50 cents.

271
00:17:35,052 --> 00:17:37,282
-Call.
-I'm in.

272
00:17:38,172 --> 00:17:40,732
I see your 50 cents. . .

273
00:17:40,972 --> 00:17:42,883
. . .and I raise you. . .

274
00:17:43,492 --> 00:17:44,368
. . . $5.

275
00:17:45,172 --> 00:17:47,402
I thought it was a 50-cent limit.

276
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:50,411
I just lost a job, and
I'd like to raise the bet $5.

277
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,688
Does anybody
have a problem with that?

278
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,688
-Not at all.
-No, no.

279
00:17:59,572 --> 00:18:00,721
Loser?

280
00:18:08,532 --> 00:18:09,601
No, I fold.

281
00:18:09,932 --> 00:18:12,287
What do you mean, you ''fold''?
What is this?

282
00:18:12,532 --> 00:18:16,730
I thought that, ''Once the cards
are dealt, I'm not a nice guy! ''

283
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:18,405
Were you just full of it?

284
00:18:32,092 --> 00:18:33,081
I'm in.

285
00:18:33,932 --> 00:18:35,968
-How many do you want?
-One.

286
00:18:37,452 --> 00:18:39,090
Dealer takes two.

287
00:18:39,692 --> 00:18:42,411
-What do you bet?
-I bet $2.

288
00:18:44,852 --> 00:18:46,285
See your 2. . .

289
00:18:46,972 --> 00:18:49,088
. . .and I raise you. . .

290
00:18:50,572 --> 00:18:51,368
. . .20.

291
00:18:57,092 --> 00:18:57,922
I see your 20. . .

292
00:18:59,892 --> 00:19:00,768
. . .raise you 25.

293
00:19:07,052 --> 00:19:08,883
See your 25. . .

294
00:19:09,372 --> 00:19:11,010
. . .and, Monica, get my purse.

295
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:17,925
There's nothing in it.

296
00:19:20,052 --> 00:19:22,282
Okay, then get me your purse.

297
00:19:27,252 --> 00:19:28,765
Here you go. Good luck!

298
00:19:28,972 --> 00:19:29,961
Thank you.

299
00:19:30,452 --> 00:19:33,922
I saw your 25 and I raise you. . .

300
00:19:34,452 --> 00:19:35,248
. . .seven.

301
00:19:36,972 --> 00:19:37,927
--teen!

302
00:19:46,092 --> 00:19:47,730
Joey, I'm a little shy.

303
00:19:48,892 --> 00:19:51,486
That's okay, Ross. You can ask me.

304
00:19:57,652 --> 00:19:59,483
-What do you need?
-Fifteen.

305
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:01,529
-Here's 1 0.
-I got 5.

306
00:20:01,772 --> 00:20:03,763
-Thank you.
-Good luck.

307
00:20:04,732 --> 00:20:07,326
I am calling your 1 7.

308
00:20:07,572 --> 00:20:09,130
What do you got?

309
00:20:19,492 --> 00:20:20,686
Full house!

310
00:20:29,492 --> 00:20:30,891
You got me.

311
00:20:41,252 --> 00:20:43,971
-That's a tough hand to beat.
-I thought we had them!

312
00:20:44,172 --> 00:20:47,847
When you don't have the cards,
you don't have the cards.

313
00:20:48,052 --> 00:20:49,929
But look how happy she is.

314
00:21:00,852 --> 00:21:01,762
-Airmail.
-Airplane.

315
00:21:01,972 --> 00:21:03,690
Airport.
Airport '7 5!

316
00:21:03,932 --> 00:21:06,844
Airport '7 7! Airport '79!

317
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:08,567
