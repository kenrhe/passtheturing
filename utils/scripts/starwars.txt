1
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,860
- Captain.
- Yes, sir?

2
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,026
Tell them we wish
to board at once.

3
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,823
With all due respect...

4
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,022
the ambassadors for the supreme
chancellor wish to board immediately.

5
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,947
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

6
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:09,028
<i>As you know,
our blockade is perfectly legal...</i>

7
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:13,063
<i>and we'd be happy
to receive the ambassadors.</i>

8
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,144
I'm TC-14 at your service.

9
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,067
This way, please.

10
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,862
We are greatly honoured
by your visit, Ambassadors.

11
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,787
Make yourselves comfortable.

12
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,140
My master
will be with you shortly.

13
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,065
I have a bad feeling about this.

14
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:01,068
- I don't sense anything.
- It's not about the mission, Master.

15
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,944
It's something elsewhere, elusive.

16
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:07,345
Don't centre on your anxieties,
Obi-Wan.

17
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,462
Keep your concentration here and now,
where it belongs.

18
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,309
But Master Yoda said
I should be mindful of the future.

19
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,341
But not at the expense
of the moment.

20
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:18,268
<i>Be mindful of the living Force,
young Padawan.</i>

21
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,221
Yes, Master.

22
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:25,820
How do you think this trade viceroy
will deal with the chancellor's demands?

23
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,986
These Federation types are cowards.

24
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,829
The negotiations will be short.

25
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,104
What? What did you say?

26
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:37,063
The ambassadors are Jedi knights,
I believe.

27
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:38,939
I knew it.

28
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,220
They're here to force a settlement.

29
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,468
Distract them.
I will contact Lord Sidious.

30
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,103
Are you brain-dead?

31
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,949
I'm not going in there
with two Jedi.

32
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,903
Send a droid.

33
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,947
Is it in their nature
to make us wait this long?

34
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,265
No. I sense
an unusual amount of fear...

35
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,426
for something as trivial
as this trade dispute.

36
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,707
<i>What is it?</i>

37
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,390
This scheme of yours has failed,
Lord Sidious.

38
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,900
The blockade is finished.
We dare not go against these Jedi.

39
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:27,626
<i>Viceroy, I don't want
this stunted slime in my sight again.</i>

40
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:32,829
<i>This turn of events is unfortunate.
We must accelerate our plans.</i>

41
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,384
<i>Begin landing your troops.</i>

42
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:39,059
My lord, is that legal?

43
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,385
<i>I will make it legal.</i>

44
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,705
And the Jedi?

45
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,219
<i>The chancellor should never have
brought them into this.</i>

46
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,022
<i>Kill them immediately.</i>

47
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:52,268
Yes, my lord.
As you wish.

48
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,788
Captain, look!

49
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,189
Shields-

50
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,347
Sorry.

51
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,827
Dioxis.

52
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,978
<i>They must be dead by now.</i>

53
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,670
<i>Destroy what's left of them.</i>

54
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,745
Oh! Excuse me.

55
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,703
- Check it out, Corporal. We'll cover you.
- Roger, roger.

56
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,222
Uh-oh. Blast them.

57
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,229
What is going on down there?

58
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,227
We lost the transmission, sir.

59
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,428
Have you ever encountered
a Jedi knight before, sir?

60
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,383
Well, no, but I don't-
Seal off the bridge.

61
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:54,104
- Yes, sir.
- That won't be enough, sir.

62
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,107
I want droidekas
up here at once!

63
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,664
We will not survive this.

64
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,103
Close the blast doors!

65
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,540
That will hold them.

66
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,264
They are still coming through.

67
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,221
This is impossible!

68
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:39,269
Where are those droidekas?

69
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,462
Master! Destroyers!

70
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,949
They have shield generators!

71
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,944
It's a standoff.
Let's go.

72
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,339
They're no match for droidekas.

73
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,062
Sir!

74
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,750
They've gone up
the ventilation shaft.

75
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:15,750
- Battle droids.
- It's an invasion army.

76
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,990
This is an odd play
for the Trade Federation.

77
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:23,068
We've got to warn the Naboo
and contact Chancellor Valorum.

78
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,669
Let's split up.

79
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:27,862
Stow aboard separate ships
and meet down on the planet.

80
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,742
You were right
about one thing, Master.

81
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,190
The negotiations were short.

82
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,619
Sir, a transmission
from the planet.

83
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,741
It's Queen Amidala herself.

84
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,179
At last we are getting results.

85
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:46,388
Again you come before us,
Your Highness.

86
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:49,468
<i>You will not be so pleased when you hear
what I have to say, Viceroy.</i>

87
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:53,139
<i>Your trade boycott
of our planet has ended.</i>

88
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,704
I was not aware of such failure.

89
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,424
<i>I have word that the chancellor's
ambassadors are with you now...</i>

90
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,144
<i>and that you have been commanded
to reach settlement.</i>

91
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,420
I know nothing
of any ambassadors.

92
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,825
You must be mistaken.

93
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,861
<i>Beware, Viceroy.</i>

94
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,584
<i>The Federation
has gone too far this time.</i>

95
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:14,589
We would never do anything
without the approval of the senate.

96
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:17,099
You assume too much.

97
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,549
<i>We will see.</i>

98
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:23,944
- She's right. The senate will never-
- It's too late now.

99
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,903
- Do you think she suspects an attack?
- I don't know.

100
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:31,182
But we must move quickly to disrupt
all communications down there.

101
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:40,065
<i>Negotiations haven't started
because the ambassadors aren't there?</i>

102
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,260
<i>How could that be true?</i>

103
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:46,542
<i>I have assurances from the chancellor
his ambassadors did arrive.</i>

104
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:50,265
<i>It must- handiwork-
negotiate- ambassadors-</i>

105
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,904
<i>- nobody would-
- Senator Palpatine.</i>

106
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,827
What's happening?

107
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,747
Check the transmission generator.

108
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:01,500
A communications disruption
can mean only one thing: invasion.

109
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:03,825
The Federation
would not dare go that far.

110
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:07,579
The senate would revoke their trade
franchise, and they'd be finished.

111
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,429
We must continue to rely
on negotiation.

112
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,622
Negotiation?
We've lost all communications.

113
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,980
And where are
the chancellor's ambassadors?

114
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,625
This is a dangerous situation,
Your Highness.

115
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,741
Our security volunteers
will be no match...

116
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,906
against a battle-hardened
Federation army.

117
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,979
I will not condone a course of action
that will lead us to war.

118
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:06,908
<i>- Yes, Viceroy?
- Captain, we've searched the ship...</i>

119
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,066
<i>and there is no trace of theJedi.</i>

120
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,829
<i>They may have gotten on
one of your landing craft.</i>

121
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:14,305
If they're down here, sir,
we'll find them.

122
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:18,582
<i>Use caution.
TheseJedi are not to be underestimated.</i>

123
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,548
- Oh, no!
- Get away! Get out of here!

124
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,261
Get down!

125
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,623
Was'n dat?
Hey, wait!

126
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,182
Oh, mooie-mooie,
I love you.

127
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,266
You almost got us killed.
Are you brainless?

128
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,948
I spake.

129
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,106
The ability to speak
does not make you intelligent.

130
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,983
- Now, get out of here.
- No, no, mesa stay.

131
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:03,022
Mesa culled Jar Jar Binks.
Mesa your humble servant.

132
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,141
- That won't be necessary.
- Oh, but it 'tis.

133
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:08,023
'Tis demanded by the gods, it 'tis.

134
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,981
- Oh, no!
- Stay down!

135
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,662
You saved my again.

136
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,587
- What's this?
- A local.

137
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:24,144
Let's get out of here
before more droids show up.

138
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:27,501
More?
"More" did you spake?

139
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:32,306
Ex-squeeze-me, but de mostest
safest place would be Gunga City.

140
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:35,502
Is where I grew up.
'Tis a hidden city.

141
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,867
- A city?
- Uh-huh.

142
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,708
Can you take us there?

143
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,948
On second thought, no.

144
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:45,459
- Not really, no.
- No?

145
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,626
'Tis embarrassing...

146
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:51,538
but my afraid
my've been banished.

147
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,628
My forgotten. Da bosses
would do terrible tings to me.

148
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,662
Terrible tings to me
if me goen back dare.

149
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:00,668
- You hear that?
- Yah.

150
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:04,385
That is the sound of a thousand
terrible things heading this way.

151
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,978
If they find us,
they will crush us...

152
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:11,467
grind us into tiny pieces
and blast us into oblivion.

153
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,228
Oh.

154
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,341
Yousa point is well seen.

155
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,700
Dis way. Hurry!

156
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,941
- How much further?
- Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?

157
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,867
Ah, my warning you.

158
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:31,949
Gungans no liken outsiders,
so don't spect a warm welcome.

159
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:35,267
Don't worry. This hasn't been
our day for warm welcomes.

160
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,579
Yousa follow me now, okeyday?

161
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,828
So good bein home!

162
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:52,018
Hey, yousa.
Stopa dare.

163
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:54,380
Heyo-dales, Cap'n Tarpals.

164
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,307
Mesa back.

165

Noah gain,Jar Jar.
Yousa goen tada bosses.

166
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,864
Yousa in big dudu dis time.

00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,943
How wude.

168
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,539
Yousa cannot bees hair.

169
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:24,027
Dis army of Mackineeks
up dare is new weesong.

170
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:28,826
A droid army is about to attack
the Naboo. We must warn them.

171
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:32,386
Wesa no like da Naboo.

172
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:35,183
Da Naboo tink day so smarty.

173
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:38,108
Day tink day brains so big.

174
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:42,189
Once those droids take control of the
surface, they will take control of you.

175
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,505
Mesa no tink so.

176
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,383
Day not know of uss-en.

177
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:50,308
You and the Naboo form
a symbiont circle.

178
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:53,661
What happens to one of you will affect
the other. You must understand this.

179
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:58,386
Wesa no carrrre-nn about da Naboo.

180
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:00,944
Then speed us on our way.

181
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:03,459
Wesa ganna speed yous away.

182
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:06,263
We could use a transport.

183
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:09,109
Wesa give yousa una bongo.

184
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:12,188
Da speediest way tooda Naboo...

185
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:16,826
'tis goen through the planet core.

186
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,747
Now...

187
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,588
go.

188
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,860
Thank you for your help.
We leave in peace.

189
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,946
Master, what's a bongo?

190
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,947
A transport, I hope.

191
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:29,061
Deysa setten yousa up.

192
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:32,660
Goen through da planet core?
Bad bombin'.

193
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:36,783
Any help here would be hot.

194
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,867
Master, we're short on time.

195
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:43,464
We'll need a navigator to get us
through the planet's core.

196
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,467
This Gungan may be of help.

197
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,422
What is to become
of Jar Jar Binks here?

198
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:55,260
Hisen to be pune-ished.

199
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,469
I saved his life.

200
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,979
He owes me
what you call a "life-debt. "

201
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:03,785
Your gods demand
that his life belongs to me now.

202
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:06,140
Binks...

203
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:10,058
<i>yousa havena liveplay
with thisen hisen?</i>

204
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,302
Begone wit him!

205
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,145
Count me outta dis one.

206
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:26,262
Better dead here
than dead in da core.

207
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:29,382
Yee gods!
What mesa sayin?

208
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:49,543
Dis is nutsen.
Oh, gooberfish!

209
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:52,787
- Why were you banished,Jar Jar?
- It's a longo tale-o...

210
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:57,745
buta a small part of it
would be mesa... clumsy.

211
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:02,466
- You were banished for being clumsy?
- Yousa might'n be sayin dat.

212
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:18,909
Mesa caused mabee one two-y
lettle bitty axadentes, huh?

213
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,986
Yud-say boom da gasser...

214
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:23,783
den crashin der boss's heyblibber,
den banished.

215
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,741
Big gooberfish!
Huge-o teeth!

216
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:46,989
- There's always a bigger fish.
- Mesa tink we goen back now.

217
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,982
The invasion is on schedule,
my lord.

218
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,988
<i>I have the senate
bogged down in procedures.</i>

219
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:08,342
<i>They will have no choice but
to accept your control of the system.</i>

220
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:12,986
The queen has great faith
that the senate will side with her.

221
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,943
<i>Queen Amidala is young and naive.</i>

222
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:19,380
<i>You will find controlling her
will not be difficult.</i>

223
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,307
Yes, my lord.

224
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:25,463
You didn't tell him
about the missing Jedi.

225
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:29,902
No need to report that to him
until we have something to report.

226
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:37,779
- Where wesa goin?
- Don't worry. The Force will guide us.

227
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:40,583
Oh, maxi big, da Force.

228
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,381
Well, dat smells stinkowiff.

229
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,985
- We're losing power.
- Oh, no!

230
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,860
Wesa dyin' here.

231
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,550
- Just relax. We're not in trouble yet.
- What "yet"?

232
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,503
Monsters out dare.
Leak'n in here.

233
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:05,385
All sink'n and no power?
Whena yousa tinkin wesa in trouble?

234
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:08,825
Power's back.

235
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,941
Monster's back!

236
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,142
Relax.

237
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,669
You overdid it.

238
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,706
Head for that outcropping.

239
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,661
Oh, boy.

240
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,541
Viceroy, we have captured the queen.

241
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:20,230
Ah, victory.

242
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,260
Dis'n loverly.

243
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,420
How will you explain this invasion
to the senate?

244
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:47,543
The queen and I will sign a treaty that
will legitimize our occupation here.

245
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:50,707
I have assurances
it will be ratified by the senate.

246
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:54,140
- I will not cooperate.
- Now, now, Your Highness.

247
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:58,229
In time, your people's suffering will
persuade you to see our point of view.

248
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,341
- Commander.
- Yes, sir.

249
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,028
Process them.

250
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,868
Captain, take them to Camp 4.

251
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,548
Roger, roger.

252
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,306
We should leave the street,
Your Highness.

253
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:02,988
Get their weapons.

254
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,900
Yousa guys bombad!

255
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,745
We're ambassadors
for the supreme chancellor.

256
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,667
Your negotiations seemed
to have failed, Ambassador.

257
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,542
The negotiations
never took place.

258
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:16,945
It's urgent that we make contact
with the Republic.

259
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,061
They've knocked out
all our communications.

260
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:22,387
- Do you have transports?
- In the main hangar. This way.

261
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:30,108
- There are too many of them.
- That won't be a problem.

262
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:33,620
Your Highness, under the circumstances,
I suggest you come to Coruscant with us.

263
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,662
Thank you, Ambassador,
but my place is with my people.

264
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:39,384
- They will kill you if you stay.
- They wouldn't dare.

265
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,466
They need her to sign a treaty
to make this invasion legal.

266
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,069
They can't afford to kill her.

267
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:45,226
There is something else behind all this,
Your Highness.

268
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,227
There's no logic
in the Federation's move here.

269
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,227
My feelings tell me
they will destroy you.

270
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,625
Our only hope is for the senate
to side with us.

271
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,105
Senator Palpatine
will need your help.

272
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:58,018
Either choice presents great danger...
to us all.

273
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,947
We are brave, Your Highness.

274
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:03,187
If you are to leave,
Your Highness, it must be now.

275
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,665
Then I will plead our case
to the senate.

276
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:08,388
Be careful, Governor.

277
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,941
We'll need to free those pilots.

278
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,947
I'll deal with that.

279
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,259
Halt.

280
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:27,982
I'm ambassador
to the supreme chancellor.

281
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,623
I'm taking these people to Coruscant.

282
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:32,822
- Where are you taking them?
- To Coruscant.

283
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:35,464
Coruscant?
Uh, that doesn't compute.

284
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,421
Uh, wait.
Uh, you're under arrest.

285
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:43,819
Come on. Move!

286
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:49,900
Go!

287
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:17,581
Now, stay here
and keep out of trouble.

288
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:23,300
Hello, boyos.

289
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:30,948
There's the blockade.

290
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,508
The shield generator's been hit!

291
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:52,183
How wude!

292
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,303
We're losing droids fast.

293
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:06,624
If we can't get the shield generator
fixed, we'll be sitting ducks.

294
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:09,904
The shields are gone.

295
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:18,984
The power's back!

296
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:24,980
That little droid did it.
He bypassed the main power drive.

297
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:27,578
Deflector shields up at maximum.

298
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:40,339
There's not enough power to get us
to Coruscant. The hyperdrive is leaking.

299
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:43,223
We'll have to land somewhere
to refuel and repair the ship.

300
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,420
Here, Master.
Tatooine.

301
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:47,142
It's small, out of the way, poor.

302
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,942
The Trade Federation
have no presence there.

303
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,867
How can you be sure?

304
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,821
It's controlled by the Hutts.

305
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:55,623
You can't take Her Royal Highness there.
The Hutts are gangsters.

306
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,945
- If they discovered her-
- It'd be no different than landing...

307
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,867
on a system controlled
by the Federation...

308
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:01,981
except that the Hutts
aren't looking for her...

309
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:04,101
which gives us the advantage.

310
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:11,268
<i>And Queen Amidala,
has she signed the treaty?</i>

311
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:14,860
She has disappeared, my lord.

312
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,983
One Naboo cruiser
got past the blockade.

313
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:21,905
<i>I want that treaty signed.</i>

314
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,986
My lord...

315
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:26,544
it's impossible to locate the ship.

316
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,786
It's out of our range.

317
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:31,060
<i>Not for a Sith.</i>

318
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,427
<i>This is my apprentice...</i>

319
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,381
<i>Darth Maul.</i>

320
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:39,821
<i>He will find your lost ship.</i>

321
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:46,185
This is getting out of hand.

322
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:48,266
Now there are two of them.

323
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:51,268
We should not
have made this bargain.

324
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:59,740
An extremely well-put-together
little droid, Your Highness.

325
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:02,623
Without a doubt, it saved the ship,
as well as our lives.

326
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:05,947
It is to be commended.
What is its number?

327
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,546
R2-D2, Your Highness.

328
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,023
Thank you, R2-D2.

329
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:17,023
PadmÈ.

330
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,546
Clean this droid up
as best you can.

331
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:22,547
It deserves our gratitude.

332
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,749
Continue, Captain.

333
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,342
Your Highness,
with your permission...

334
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:33,109
we're heading for a remote planet
called Tatooine.

335
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:36,427
It's in a system far beyond the reach
of the Trade Federation.

336
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:39,018
I do not agree
with the Jedi on this.

337
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:41,948
You must trust my judgment,
Your Highness.

338
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,868
Hello.

339
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:49,823
Sorry. Husa are yousa?

340
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:52,303
I'm PadmÈ.

341
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:55,301
Mesa Jar Jar Binks.

342
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,338
You're a Gungan, aren't you?

343
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:02,986
- How'd you end up here with us?
- My no know.

344
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:06,625
Mesa day starten pitty okeyday
witda brisky morning munchen.

345
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:09,423
Den boom!
Getten berry scared...

346
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:12,701
and grabben dat Jedi, and pow-
mesa here.

347
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:16,419
Mesa getten
berry, berry scared.

348
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:25,428
- That's it- Tatooine.
- There's a settlement.

349
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:29,463
Land near the outskirts.
We don't want to attract attention.

350
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:48,703
The hyperdrive generator's gone, Master.
We'll need a new one.

351
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:51,185
That'll complicate things.
Be wary.

352
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:54,302
- I sense a disturbance in the Force.
- I feel it also, Master.

353
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:56,386
Don't let them send
any transmissions.

354
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:04,539
The sun doen murder to mesa skin.

355
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:06,103
Wait!

356
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,503
Wait.

357
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:14,543
Her Highness commands you
to take her handmaiden with you.

358
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:18,265
No more commands
from Her Highness today, Captain.

359
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,381
The spaceport
is not going to be pleasant.

360
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,546
The queen wishes it.

361
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,501
She's curious about the planet.

362
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:29,902
This is not a good idea.
Stay close to me.

363
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,869
Moisture farms,
for the most part.

364
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:50,659
Some indigenous tribes
and scavengers.

365
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,587
The few spaceports like this one...

366
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,905
are havens for those
that don't wish to be found.

367
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,861
Like us.

368
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:00,823
Dissen berry, berry bad.

369
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:03,788
Icky, icky goo!

370
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:18,579
We'll try one of the smaller dealers.

371
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,867
Good day to you.

372
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:28,789
What do you want?

373
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,868
I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.

374
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:35,869
Ah, yes! Nubian.
We have lots of that.

375
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:38,387
Boy, get in here now!

376
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:40,307
My droid has a readout of what I need.

377
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,422
What took you so long?

378
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,549
I was cleaning the fan switches.

379
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:49,309
Watch the store.
I've got some selling to do.

380
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:52,547
So, let me take thee out back, huh?

381
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:54,467
We'll find what you need.

382
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:58,508
Don't touch anything.

383
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:11,183
- Are you an angel?
- What?

384
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:14,859
An angel. I heard the deep space
pilots talk about them.

385
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:17,743
They're the most beautiful
creatures in the universe.

386
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:20,338
They live on the moons of lego,
I think.

387
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:24,625
You're a funny little boy.
How do you know so much?

388
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:28,425
I listen to all the traders
and star pilots who come through here.

389
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:32,668
I'm a pilot, you know, and someday
I'm gonna fly away from this place.

390
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:36,578
- You're a pilot?
- Mm-hmm. All my life.

391
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:38,905
How long have you been here?

392
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:42,864
Since I was very little.
Three, I think.

393
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:45,584
My mom and I were sold
to Gardulla the Hutt...

394
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:48,304
but she lost us
betting on the Podraces.

395
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:50,148
You're a slave?

396
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:54,229
- I'm a person, and my name is Anakin.
- I'm sorry.

397
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:57,945
I don't fully understand.
This is a strange place to me.

398
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,349
- I got ya.
- Hey!

399
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:13,142
Hit the nose.

400
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:21,020
A T-14 hyperdrive generator.
Thee in luck.

401
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:23,664
I'm the only one hereabouts
who has one.

402
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:27,146
But thee might as well buy a new ship.
It would be cheaper, I think, huh.

403
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,069
Saying of which...

404
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,465
how's thee gonna pay
for all this, huh?

405
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,546
I have 20,000 Republic dataries.

406
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:36,422
Republic credits?

407
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:39,348
Republic credits are no good out here.
I need something more real.

408
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:42,462
I don't have anything else,
but credits will do fine.

409
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:46,060
<i>- No, they won't.
- Credits will do fine.</i>

410
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,942
No, they won't!

411
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:52,063
What, you think you're some kind of Jedi,
waving your hand around like that?

412
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:56,263
I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks
don't work on me. Only money.

413
00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:00,301
No money, no parts, no deal.

414
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:04,787
And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive,
I promise you that.

415
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:15,463
Wouldn't have lasted long anyways
if I wasn't so good at building things.

416
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,867
We're leaving. Jar Jar.

417
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:25,824
I'm glad to have met you, Anakin.

418
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,702
I was glad to meet you too.

419
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:40,107
Outlanders.
They think we know nothing.

420
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:42,061
They seemed nice to me.

421
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:44,021
Clean the racks.

422
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:45,424
Then you can go home.

423
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:47,268
Yippee!

424
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:55,345
<i>And you're sure there's
nothing left on board?</i>

425
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:57,267
A few containers of supplies.

426
00:33:57,390 --> 00:34:00,302
The queen's wardrobe, maybe,
but not enough for you to barter with...

427
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:02,660
<i>not in the amount
you're talking about.</i>

428
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:05,588
All right. I'm sure
another solution will present itself.

429
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,029
I'll check back later.

430
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:09,382
Noah gain. Noah gain.

431
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:12,229
Da beings hereabouts, cawazy!

432
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,705
Wesa be wobbed un crunched.

433
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:17,867
Not likely. We have nothing of value.
That's our problem.

434
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,863
Are you going to pay for that?

435
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:37,587
It costs seven wupiupi.

436
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:43,944
Oops.

437
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:50,067
Is this yours?

438
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,862
Who, mesa-

439
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:57,906
Careful, Sebulba.

440
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,941
He's a big-time outlander.

441
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:03,460
I'd hate to see you diced
before we race again.

442
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:07,299
Next time we race, boy,
it will be the end of you.

443
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:10,342
If you weren't a slave,
I'd squash you now.

444
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:13,749
Yeah, it'd be a pity
if you had to pay for me.

445
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:17,822
- Hi.
- Hi there.

446
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,668
Your buddy here was
about to be turned into orange goo.

447
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:21,587
He picked a fight with a Dug...

448
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:24,099
an especially dangerous Dug
called Sebulba.

449
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:27,666
Mesa haten crunchen.
Das da las ting mesa want.

450
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:31,624
Nevertheless, the boy is right.
You were heading into trouble.

451
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,549
Thanks, my young friend.

452
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,547
But mesa doen nutten!

453
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,178
This storm will slow them down.

454
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:49,743
Looks pretty bad.

455
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:53,419
<i>- Panaka.
- Receiving a message from home.</i>

456
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:55,268
We'll be right there.

457
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:03,500
Here, you'll like these pallies.

458
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:06,098
- Here.
- Thank you.

459
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:09,425
My bones are aching.

460
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:13,907
Storm's coming up, Ani.
You better get home quick.

461
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:16,749
- Do you have shelter?
- We'll head back to our ship.

462
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:19,338
- Is it far?
- It's on the outskirts.

463
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:21,745
You'll never reach
the outskirts in time.

464
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:25,579
Sandstorms are very, very dangerous.

465
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:28,065
Come on.
I'll take you to my place.

466
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,339
Mom!

467
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:47,019
- Mom, I'm home!
- Ah, dissen cosy.

468
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:49,425
- These are my friends, Mom.
- Hello.

469
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:52,940
- I'm Qui-Gon Jinn.
- I'm building a droid. You wanna see?

470
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:55,345
Your son was kind enough
to offer us shelter.

471
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,347
Come on. I'll show you 3PO.

472
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:09,867
Isn't he great?
He's not finished yet.

473
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:11,218
He's wonderful.

474
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,068
You really like him?

475
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,988
He's a protocol droid
to help Mom. Watch.

476
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,458
Where is everybody?

477
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:23,705
Whoops.

478
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:27,905
Oh, hello.

479
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:31,181
I am C-3PO,
human cyborg relations.

480
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:33,107
How might I serve you?

481
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:35,903
- He's perfect.
- Oh. Perfect.

482
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:39,420
When the storm is over, I'll show you
my racer. I'm building a Podracer.

483
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:43,184
I'm not sure this floor
is entirely stable.

484
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:46,382
Hello. I don't believe
we have been introduced.

485
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:50,380
R2-D2.
A pleasure to meet you.

486
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:53,422
I am C-3PO,
human cyborg relations.

487
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:59,022
I beg your pardon,
but what do you mean, "naked"?

488
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:03,747
My parts are showing?
My goodness!

489
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:10,545
<i>The death toll is catastrophic.</i>

490
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:12,945
<i>We must bow to their wishes.</i>

491
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:15,026
<i>You must contact me.</i>

492
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:17,710
It's a trick.
Send no reply.

493
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:19,741
Send no transmissions of any kind.

494
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:24,703
It sounds like bait
to establish a connection trace.

495
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:28,618
<i>What if it is true,
and the people are dying?</i>

496
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:31,105
Either way,
we're running out of time.

497
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:46,226
Tatooine is sparsely populated.

498
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:49,023
If the trace was correct,
I will find them quickly, Master.

499
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,947
Move against the Jedi first.

500
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:53,664
You will then have no difficulty
in taking the queen to Naboo...

501
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,587
to sign the treaty.

502
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,780
At last we will reveal ourselves
to the Jedi.

503
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:00,219
At last we will have revenge.

504
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:03,103
You have been well-trained,
my young apprentice.

505
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:05,505
They will be no match for you.

506
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:14,024
All slaves have a transmitter
placed inside their bodies somewhere.

507
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:17,948
I've been working on a scanner
to try and locate mine.

508
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:21,426
- Any attempt to escape-
- And they blow you up!

509
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:23,823
How wude!

510
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:26,259
I can't believe
there's still slavery in the galaxy.

511
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:28,187
The Republic's antislavery laws-

512
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:30,540
The Republic doesn't exist out here.

513
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,740
We must survive on our own.

514
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,143
Xcuse me.

515
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:39,584
Has anybody ever seen a Podrace?

516
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,428
They have Podracing
on Malastare.

517
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:44,144
Very fast, very dangerous.

518
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:46,707
I'm the only human who can do it.

519
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:49,708
You must have Jedi reflexes
if you race pods.

520
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:52,109
Don't do that again.

521
00:39:57,350 --> 00:39:59,818
You're a Jedi knight, aren't you?

522
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:05,423
- What makes you think that?
- I saw your laser sword.

523
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:08,303
Only Jedis carry
that kind of weapon.

524
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:11,422
Perhaps I killed a Jedi
and took it from him.

525
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:13,108
I don't think so.

526
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:15,300
No one can kill a Jedi.

527
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:18,066
I wish that were so.

528
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,146
I had a dream I was a Jedi.

529
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:23,307
I came back here
and freed all the slaves.

530
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:26,627
- Have you come to free us?
- No, I'm afraid not.

531
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:30,902
I think you have.
Why else would you be here?

532
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:38,229
I can see there's
no fooling you, Anakin.

533
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:41,228
We're on our way to Coruscant,
the central system in the Republic...

534
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:43,261
on a very important mission.

535
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:46,302
How did you end up out here
in the outer rim?

536
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:49,900
Our ship was damaged, and we're
stranded here until we can repair it.

537
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:54,182
I can help.
I can fix anything.

538
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:55,743
I believe you can.

539
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,543
But first we must acquire
the parts we need.

540
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:01,264
Wit no-nutten mula to trade.

541
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:04,780
These junk dealers
must have a weakness of some kind.

542
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:09,028
Gambling. Everything here revolves
around betting on those awful races.

543
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:10,344
Podracing.

544
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:13,268
Greed can be a powerful ally.

545
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:16,143
I built a racer.
It's the fastest ever.

546
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:18,465
There's a big race tomorrow
on Boonta Eve.

547
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:20,467
You could enter my pod.

548
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:24,302
- Anakin, Watto won't let you.
- Watto doesn't know I've built it.

549
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:26,227
You could make him think
it was yours...

550
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,466
and get him
to let me pilot it for you.

551
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:30,103
I don't want you to race.
It's awful.

552
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:32,619
I die every time
Watto makes you do it.

553
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:34,786
But, Mom, I love it.

554
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:38,300
The prize money would more than pay
for the parts they need.

555
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:40,625
Anakin.

556
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:43,389
Your mother's right.

557
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:46,468
Is there anyone friendly to the Republic
who can help us?

558
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:49,502
No.

559
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:58,827
Mom, you say the biggest problem in this
universe is nobody helps each other.

560
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:06,223
I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want
to put your son in danger.

561
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:08,181
We'll find some other way.

562
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:12,905
There is no other way.

563
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:17,182
I may not like it,
but he can help you.

564
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:19,827
He was meant to help you.

565
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:34,627
Are you sure about this?

566
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:37,264
Trusting our fate
to a boy we hardly know?

567
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:39,346
The queen will not approve.

568
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:41,267
The queen doesn't need to know.

569
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:43,908
Well, I don't approve.

570
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:47,504
The boy tells me you want
to sponsor him in the race.

571
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:49,188
How can you do this?

572
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:52,461
Not on the Republic credits,
I think.

573
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:54,660
My ship will be the entry fee.

574
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:56,788
Not bad!

575
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:59,743
Not bad, huh?
Nubian, huh?

576
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:03,021
It's in good order,
except for the parts I need.

577
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:05,539
What would the boy ride?

578
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:09,060
He smashed up my pod in the last race.
It would take some long time to fix it.

579
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:11,420
It wasn't my fault.
Really.

580
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:13,108
Sebulba flashed me with his vents.

581
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:16,461
I actually saved the pod, mostly.

582
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:19,905
That you did.

583
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:22,703
The boy's good.
No doubts there, huh?

584
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:25,219
I have acquired a pod
in a game of chance.

585
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:26,942
The fastest ever built.

586
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:31,985
I hope you didn't kill
anyone I know for it, huh?

587
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:37,260
So, you supply the pod
and the entry fee...

588
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:38,709
and I supply the boy.

589
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:42,539
We split the winnings 50-50,
I think, huh?

590
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:44,467
If it's going to be 50-50...

591
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:47,104
I suggest you front the cash
for the entry.

592
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:49,186
If we win...

593
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:52,939
<i>you keep all the winnings,
minus the cost of the parts I need.</i>

594
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:56,142
<i>And if we lose,
you keep my ship.</i>

595
00:43:58,510 --> 00:43:59,863
Either way, you win.

596
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:06,704
Deal!

597
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:15,783
Your friend
is a foolish one, methinks.

598
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:26,228
What if this plan fails, Master?

599
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:28,944
We could be stuck here
a very long time.

600
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:31,504
<i>Well, it's too dangerous
to call for help...</i>

601
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:34,861
and a ship without a power supply
isn't going to get us anywhere.

602
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:36,867
And...

603
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:38,787
there's something about this boy.

604
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:47,580
You should be very proud of your son.

605
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:50,540
He gives without any thought
of reward.

606
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:53,423
He knows nothing of greed.

607
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:54,585
He has-

608
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:57,347
He has special powers.

609
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:00,219
Yes.

610
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:02,864
He can see things
before they happen.

611
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:05,663
That's why he appears
to have such quick reflexes.

612
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:07,587
It's a Jedi trait.

613
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:10,383
He deserves better
than a slave's life.

614
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:13,741
Had he been born in the Republic,
we would have identified him early.

615
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:19,665
The Force is unusually strong with him.
That much is clear.

616
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:21,462
Who was his father?

617
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:25,901
There was no father.

618
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:30,507
I carried him,
I gave birth, I raised him.

619
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:33,739
I can't explain what happened.

620
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:37,068
Can you help him?

621
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:38,987
I don't know.

622
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:44,860
I didn't actually come here
to free slaves.

623
00:45:57,470 --> 00:45:59,267
Wow, a real astro droid!

624
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:04,705
- How do you get so lucky?
- That isn't the half of it.

625
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:07,663
- I'm in the Boonta race tomorrow.
- What?

626
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:09,428
With this?

627
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:12,189
You're such a joker, Ani.

628
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:15,382
- You've been working on that for years.
- It's never gonna run.

629
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:17,580
Come on.
Let's go and play ball.

630
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:20,861
Keep racing, Ani.
You're gonna be bug squash.

631
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:31,345
Keep away from
those energy binders.

632
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:34,780
If your hand gets caught in the beam,
it's gonna go numb for hours.

633
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:36,229
Okay.

634
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:42,224
My tongue is fat.

635
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:45,308
My tongue- Wrench.

636
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:47,990
Where is de wrench?
Oh, dare it is.

637
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:53,749
I'm stuck.

638
00:46:53,870 --> 00:46:57,704
You know, I find that Jar Jar creature
to be a little odd.

639
00:46:59,470 --> 00:47:02,189
You don't even know
if this thing's gonna run.

640
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:04,301
- It will.
- I think it's time we found out.

641
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:06,546
- Here, use this power charge.
- Yes, sir!

642
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:08,626
Come on, Kitster.
Let's move away.

643
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:10,866
My mouth.

644
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:12,264
Ani, I'm stuck.

645
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:19,340
My tongue is fat.

646
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:22,303
You're quite right.
He's very odd indeed.

647
00:47:24,430 --> 00:47:26,386
Thank you.

648
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,863
Go.

649
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:45,260
It's working!
It's working!

650
00:47:55,470 --> 00:47:57,859
Stay still, Ani.
Let me clean this cut.

651
00:47:57,990 --> 00:48:01,744
There's so many.
Do they all have a system of planets?

652
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:03,667
Most of them.

653
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:05,667
Has anyone been to 'em all?

654
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:08,459
Not likely.

655
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:11,666
I wanna be the first one
to see 'em all.

656
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:15,105
Ani, bedtime!

657
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:17,869
There we are.
Good as new.

658
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:20,743
Ani, I'm not gonna tell you again.

659
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:24,146
- What are you doing?
- Checking your blood for infections.

660
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:25,749
Go on.

661
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:27,747
You have a big day tomorrow.

662
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:29,667
Sleep well, Ani.

663
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:34,221
<i>- Obi-Wan?
- Yes, Master?</i>

664
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:36,944
I need an analysis
of this blood sample I'm sending you.

665
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:38,708
Wait a minute.

666
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:42,227
I need a midi-chlorian count.

667
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:47,584
The reading is off the chart.

668
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:49,507
Over 20,000.

669
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:53,100
<i>Even Master Yoda doesn't have
a midi-chlorian count that high.</i>

670
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:54,948
No Jedi has.

671
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:57,026
What does that mean?

672
00:48:57,870 --> 00:48:59,428
I'm not sure.

673
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:09,263
I wanna see your spaceship
the moment the race is over.

674
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:11,062
Patience, my blue friend.

675
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:13,340
You'll have your winnings
before the suns set.

676
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:15,188
And we'll be far away from here.

677
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:19,189
Not if your ship belongs to me,
I think, huh?

678
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:22,541
I warn you, no funny business.

679
00:50:22,670 --> 00:50:25,662
- You don't think Anakin can win?
- Don't get me wrongo.

680
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:28,145
I have great faith in the boy.

681
00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:30,306
He's a credit to your race...

682
00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:33,502
but Sebulba there
is going to win, I think.

683
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:37,222
Oh, no!

684
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:42,982
Why do you think that?

685
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:44,907
He always wins!

686
00:50:46,830 --> 00:50:49,185
I am betting heavily on Sebulba.

687
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:53,544
- I'll take that bet.
- What?

688
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:57,467
I'll wager my new racing pod
against, say...

689
00:50:57,590 --> 00:50:59,387
the boy and his mother.

690
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:03,059
No pod is worth two slaves,
not by a long shot.

691
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:05,622
The boy, then.

692
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:13,979
We'll let fate decide, huh?

693
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:17,386
I just happen to have
a chance cube here.

694
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:20,422
Blue, it's the boy.

695
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:21,619
Red...

696
00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:24,548
his mother.

697
00:51:33,870 --> 00:51:36,179
You won this small toss,
outlander...

698
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:38,346
but you won't win the race!

699
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,461
So it makes little difference!

700
00:51:49,870 --> 00:51:54,580
Better stop your friend's betting
or I'll end up owning him too.

701
00:51:58,190 --> 00:52:00,579
- What'd he mean by that?
- I'll tell you later.

702
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:02,029
Good morning.

703
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:06,709
Oh, my.
Space travel sounds rather perilous.

704
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:12,544
I can assure you, they will never get me
onto one of those dreadful starships.

705
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:15,901
This is so wizard, Ani.
I'm sure you'll do it this time.

706
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:17,065
Do what?

707
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:20,102
Finish the race, of course.

708
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:21,902
You've never won a race?

709
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:24,624
Well, not exactly.

710
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:26,661
Not even finished?

711
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:29,145
Kitster's right.
I will this time.

712
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:31,226
Of course you will.

713
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:01,422
That's absolutely right.

714
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:06,385
And a big turnout here from all corners
of the outer rim territories.

715
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:09,980
I see the contestants are making
their way out onto the starting grid.

716
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:14,709
<i>I see Ben Quadinaros
from the Tund System.</i>

717
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:22,505
<i>Two-time winner Boles Roor.</i>

718
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:26,668
<i>Sebulba!</i>

719
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:39,628
And in the front row,
nearside pole position...

720
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:41,661
<i>Mawhonic!</i>

721
00:53:42,830 --> 00:53:44,786
<i>A hearty hello...</i>

722
00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:48,459
<i>to Clegg Holdfast
and his Voltec KT9 Wasp!</i>

723
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:54,228
<i>And back again,
it's the mighty Dud Bolt...</i>

724
00:53:54,350 --> 00:53:58,741
<i>with that incredible racing machine,
the Vulptereen 327.</i>

725
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:04,145
<i>And hoping for a big win today...</i>

726
00:54:04,270 --> 00:54:08,502
<i>Ody Mandrell,
with his record-setting pit droid team.</i>

727
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:16,307
<i>And a late entry,
young Anakin Skywalker...</i>

728
00:54:16,430 --> 00:54:17,658
<i>a local boy.</i>

729
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:22,420
I see the flags are moving
out onto the track.

730
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:43,309
Be safe.

731
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:45,660
I will, Mom. I promise.

732
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:03,750
You won't walk away from this one...

733
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:06,020
<i>you slave scum.</i>

734
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:09,267
Don't count on it, slime ball.

735
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:11,665
You're bantha fodder!

736
00:55:16,070 --> 00:55:18,186
- You all set, Ani?
- Yep.

737
00:55:18,310 --> 00:55:19,868
Right.

738
00:55:23,830 --> 00:55:26,344
Remember, concentrate
on the moment.

739
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:30,065
Feel, don't think.
Use your instincts.

740
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:31,748
I will.

741
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:33,986
May the Force be with you.

742
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:44,501
Jabba the Hutt.

743
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:58,542
Welcome.

744
00:55:59,470 --> 00:56:02,587
Begin the race!

745
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:15,747
<i>Hey, looks like
they're clearing the grid.</i>

746
00:56:16,910 --> 00:56:18,707
- Is he nervous?
- He's fine.

747
00:56:20,270 --> 00:56:23,023
You Jedi are far too reckless.
The queen is not-

748
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:25,903
<i>The queen trusts my judgment,
young handmaiden.</i>

749
00:56:26,030 --> 00:56:28,146
You should too.

750
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:30,261
You assume too much.

751
00:56:30,990 --> 00:56:33,299
<i>Start your engines.</i>

752
00:57:10,990 --> 00:57:14,187
Oh, dissen gonna be messy.
Me no watch'n!

753
00:57:33,390 --> 00:57:34,618
Oh, no!

754
00:57:40,030 --> 00:57:43,181
Wait.
Little Skywalker has stalled.

755
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:57,269
<i>It looks like Quadinaros
is having engine trouble also.</i>

756
00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:00,018
Come on, Ani!

757
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:07,703
<i>And there goes Skywalker!</i>

758
00:58:07,830 --> 00:58:09,229
Go, Ani, go!

759
00:58:09,350 --> 00:58:11,386
<i>He will be hard-pressed
to catch up with the leaders.</i>

760
00:59:22,470 --> 00:59:25,268
<i>Looks like a few Tusken Raiders
are camped out...</i>

761
00:59:25,390 --> 00:59:27,585
<i>on the canyon dune turn.</i>

762
00:59:38,350 --> 00:59:41,899
There goes Quadinaros'
power coupling.

763
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:10,626
Oh, no!

764
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:17,027
Where is Master Anakin?

765
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:22,266
Look. Here he comes.

766
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:27,260
<i>It looks like Skywalker
is moving up in the field.</i>

767
01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:29,463
Yay! Yippee!

768
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:40,106
He has to complete
two more circuits? Oh, dear.

769
01:01:44,950 --> 01:01:46,747
Skywalker's
spinning out of control!

770
01:02:42,310 --> 01:02:46,098
I don't care what universe you're from.
That's gotta hurt!

771
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:54,508
Here he comes!

772
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:57,622
<i>At the start of the third and final lap,
Sebulba's in the lead...</i>

773
01:02:57,750 --> 01:03:00,139
<i>followed closely by Skywalker!</i>

774
01:03:00,270 --> 01:03:01,100
Go, Ani!

775
01:03:27,030 --> 01:03:29,260
Skywalker's been forced
onto the service ramp!

776
01:03:50,070 --> 01:03:51,389
It's Skywalker!

777
01:03:52,310 --> 01:03:53,584
Sebulba!

778
01:03:53,710 --> 01:03:57,783
Amazing! A quick control thrust,
and he's back on course!

779
01:03:57,910 --> 01:03:59,582
Did he crash-ed?

780
01:04:38,870 --> 01:04:41,942
Skywalker's in trouble!
Sebulba takes the lead!

781
01:05:32,790 --> 01:05:34,382
He's catching Sebulba!

782
01:05:35,470 --> 01:05:37,859
Careful, Ani. Careful, Ani!

783
01:06:06,990 --> 01:06:09,265
That little human being
is out of his mind!

784
01:06:10,350 --> 01:06:11,465
<i>They're side by side!</i>

785
01:06:38,950 --> 01:06:40,747
- Yippee!
- Yay!

786
01:06:44,790 --> 01:06:46,428
I can't believe it.

787
01:06:46,550 --> 01:06:48,381
The crowds are going nuts!

788
01:06:56,950 --> 01:06:58,906
Yay, Ani!

789
01:07:00,190 --> 01:07:03,102
Mom, I did it! Yay!

790
01:07:13,190 --> 01:07:14,987
Good going, Ani!

791
01:07:19,190 --> 01:07:21,067
We owe you everything, Ani.

792
01:07:23,590 --> 01:07:25,626
It's so wonderful, Ani.

793
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:28,344
You have brought hope
to those who have none.

794
01:07:28,470 --> 01:07:30,586
I'm so very proud of you.

795
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:42,427
You!

796
01:07:42,550 --> 01:07:44,745
You swindled me.

797
01:07:44,870 --> 01:07:48,499
You knew the boy was going to win.
Somehow you knew it.

798
01:07:48,630 --> 01:07:50,427
I lost everything.

799
01:07:50,550 --> 01:07:53,940
Whenever you gamble, my friend,
eventually you lose.

800
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:56,425
Bring the parts
to the main hangar.

801
01:07:56,550 --> 01:07:59,508
I'll come by your shop later on
so you can release the boy.

802
01:07:59,630 --> 01:08:02,781
You can't have him.
It wasn't a fair bet.

803
01:08:05,430 --> 01:08:08,740
Would you like to discuss it
with the Hutts?

804
01:08:08,870 --> 01:08:11,259
I'm sure they can settle this.

805
01:08:12,710 --> 01:08:14,507
Take him.

806
01:08:21,190 --> 01:08:22,179
Hidoe!

807
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:25,741
Well, we have all
the essential parts we need.

808
01:08:25,870 --> 01:08:26,859
I'm going back.

809
01:08:26,990 --> 01:08:28,981
Some unfinished business.
I won't be long.

810
01:08:29,110 --> 01:08:32,420
Why do I sense we've picked up
another pathetic life-form?

811
01:08:33,190 --> 01:08:36,182
It's the boy who's responsible
for getting us these parts.

812
01:08:36,310 --> 01:08:38,107
Get this hyperdrive
generator installed.

813
01:08:38,230 --> 01:08:40,664
Yes, Master.
That shouldn't take long.

814
01:08:40,790 --> 01:08:42,860
Come on. Hup!

815
01:08:47,310 --> 01:08:49,107
Hey. These are yours.

816
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:52,224
Yes!

817
01:08:53,710 --> 01:08:56,349
Mom, we sold the pod!
Look at all the money we have!

818
01:08:56,470 --> 01:08:58,745
My goodness!
But that's so wonderful, Ani.

819
01:08:58,870 --> 01:09:01,703
- And he has been freed.
- What?

820
01:09:01,830 --> 01:09:03,548
You're no longer a slave.

821
01:09:05,390 --> 01:09:07,221
Did you hear that?

822
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:10,345
<i>Now you can make
your dreams come true, Ani.</i>

823
01:09:11,190 --> 01:09:13,021
You are free.

824
01:09:16,470 --> 01:09:17,869
Will you take him with you?

825
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:19,548
Is he to become a Jedi?

826
01:09:19,670 --> 01:09:22,104
Yes. Our meeting
was not a coincidence.

827
01:09:22,910 --> 01:09:24,502
Nothing happens by accident.

828
01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:28,020
You mean I get to come with you
in your starship?

829
01:09:28,150 --> 01:09:29,503
Anakin...

830
01:09:31,350 --> 01:09:34,501
training to become a Jedi
is not an easy challenge...

831
01:09:34,630 --> 01:09:37,383
and even if you succeed,
it's a hard life.

832
01:09:37,510 --> 01:09:40,547
But I wanna go. It's what
I've always dreamed of doing.

833
01:09:41,350 --> 01:09:43,386
Can I go, Mom?

834
01:09:44,310 --> 01:09:45,902
Anakin...

835
01:09:46,030 --> 01:09:48,828
this path has been placed
before you.

836
01:09:48,950 --> 01:09:51,305
The choice is yours alone.

837
01:09:54,830 --> 01:09:56,627
I wanna do it.

838
01:09:59,110 --> 01:10:01,226
Then pack your things.
We haven't much time.

839
01:10:07,590 --> 01:10:09,103
What about Mom?

840
01:10:12,110 --> 01:10:13,907
Is she free too?

841
01:10:14,030 --> 01:10:17,386
I tried to free your mother, Ani,
but Watto wouldn't have it.

842
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:20,267
You're coming with us,
aren't you, Mom?

843
01:10:27,950 --> 01:10:31,147
Son, my place is here.
My future is here.

844
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:33,545
It is time for you to let go.

845
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:36,666
I don't want things to change.

846
01:10:36,790 --> 01:10:39,065
But you can't stop the change...

847
01:10:39,190 --> 01:10:42,148
any more than you can
stop the suns from setting.

848
01:10:43,190 --> 01:10:45,021
I love you.

849
01:10:50,470 --> 01:10:52,267
Now hurry.

850
01:10:57,590 --> 01:10:58,909
Thank you.

851
01:10:59,030 --> 01:11:01,828
I'll watch after him.
You have my word.

852
01:11:03,990 --> 01:11:05,423
Will you be all right?

853
01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:08,229
Yeah.

854
01:11:13,070 --> 01:11:14,583
Hello, Master Anakin.

855
01:11:14,710 --> 01:11:16,701
Well, 3PO, I've been freed...

856
01:11:16,830 --> 01:11:19,105
and I'm going away in a starship.

857
01:11:19,230 --> 01:11:22,028
Master Anakin, you are my maker
and I wish you well.

858
01:11:22,150 --> 01:11:26,189
However, I should prefer it
if I were a little more completed.

859
01:11:26,310 --> 01:11:29,302
I'm sorry I wasn't able
to finish you, 3PO...

860
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:31,386
give you coverings and all.

861
01:11:31,510 --> 01:11:33,068
I'm gonna miss working on you.

862
01:11:33,190 --> 01:11:35,545
You've been a great pal.

863
01:11:35,670 --> 01:11:38,184
I'll make sure Mom
doesn't sell you or anything.

864
01:11:38,950 --> 01:11:39,939
Sell me?

865
01:11:40,070 --> 01:11:41,628
Bye.

866
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:43,069
Oh, my.

867
01:12:06,710 --> 01:12:08,826
I can't do it, Mom.
I just can't do it.

868
01:12:12,950 --> 01:12:14,861
Will I ever see you again?

869
01:12:16,270 --> 01:12:19,023
What does your heart tell you?

870
01:12:20,310 --> 01:12:22,141
I hope so.

871
01:12:22,870 --> 01:12:24,667
Yes.

872
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:26,303
I guess.

873
01:12:27,310 --> 01:12:29,778
Then we will
see each other again.

874
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:35,063
I will come back
and free you, Mom.

875
01:12:35,190 --> 01:12:36,828
I promise.

876
01:12:44,750 --> 01:12:47,583
Now, be brave...

877
01:12:48,350 --> 01:12:50,261
and don't look back.

878
01:12:51,030 --> 01:12:52,827
Don't look back.

879
01:13:35,590 --> 01:13:36,625
Qui-Gon, sir, wait!

880
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:38,422
- I'm tired!
- Anakin! Drop!

881
01:13:40,790 --> 01:13:41,700
Go!

882
01:13:42,710 --> 01:13:44,541
Tell them to take off!

883
01:13:56,630 --> 01:13:58,029
Qui-Gon's in trouble.

884
01:13:59,270 --> 01:14:00,589
Take off.

885
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:02,942
Over there. Fly low.

886
01:14:23,670 --> 01:14:26,548
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

887
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:28,149
What was it?

888
01:14:28,270 --> 01:14:29,942
I'm not sure...

889
01:14:30,070 --> 01:14:32,504
but it was well-trained
in the Jedi arts.

890
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:35,025
My guess is
it was after the queen.

891
01:14:35,150 --> 01:14:37,539
What are we gonna do about it?

892
01:14:39,430 --> 01:14:40,988
We shall be patient.

893
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:42,179
Anakin Skywalker...

894
01:14:42,310 --> 01:14:44,028
meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.

895
01:14:46,350 --> 01:14:48,784
You're a Jedi too?
Pleased to meet you.

896
01:14:57,390 --> 01:14:59,824
<i>Your queen is lost,
your people are starving...</i>

897
01:14:59,950 --> 01:15:01,861
and you, Governor,
are going to die...

898
01:15:01,990 --> 01:15:04,026
much sooner than your people,
I'm afraid.

899
01:15:04,150 --> 01:15:06,539
This invasion
will gain you nothing.

900
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:09,548
We're a democracy.
The people have decided.

901
01:15:09,670 --> 01:15:11,467
Take him away.

902
01:15:14,790 --> 01:15:17,145
My troops are in position
to begin searching the swamps...

903
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:19,704
for these rumoured
underwater villages.

904
01:15:19,830 --> 01:15:22,344
They will not
stay hidden for long.

905
01:15:32,950 --> 01:15:35,544
<i>The death toll is catastrophic.</i>

906
01:15:35,670 --> 01:15:38,184
<i>We must bow to their wishes.</i>

907
01:15:38,310 --> 01:15:40,426
<i>You must contact me.</i>

908
01:15:53,990 --> 01:15:55,821
You all right?

909
01:15:56,830 --> 01:15:58,661
It's very cold.

910
01:16:06,310 --> 01:16:08,949
You come from
a warm planet, Ani.

911
01:16:09,070 --> 01:16:11,345
A little too warm
for my taste.

912
01:16:11,470 --> 01:16:13,620
Space is cold.

913
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:15,786
You seem sad.

914
01:16:16,910 --> 01:16:19,060
The queen is worried.

915
01:16:19,190 --> 01:16:21,499
Her people are suffering, dying.

916
01:16:21,630 --> 01:16:24,986
She must convince the senate
to intervene or...

917
01:16:26,390 --> 01:16:28,585
I'm not sure what'll happen.

918
01:16:29,990 --> 01:16:31,946
I made this for you...

919
01:16:33,390 --> 01:16:35,187
so you'd remember me.

920
01:16:35,870 --> 01:16:38,430
I carved it
out of a japor snippet.

921
01:16:38,550 --> 01:16:41,269
It'll bring you good fortune.

922
01:16:41,390 --> 01:16:43,187
It's beautiful.

923
01:16:43,310 --> 01:16:45,585
But I don't need this
to remember you by.

924
01:16:49,110 --> 01:16:52,341
Many things will change
when we reach the capital, Ani...

925
01:16:52,470 --> 01:16:54,904
but my caring for you will remain.

926
01:16:57,510 --> 01:17:00,502
I care for you, too, only I-

927
01:17:00,630 --> 01:17:02,700
Miss your mother.

928
01:17:20,430 --> 01:17:24,423
Coruscant.
The entire planet is one big city.

929
01:17:24,550 --> 01:17:26,222
There's Chancellor Valorum's shuttle.

930
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:29,467
And look over there.
Senator Palpatine is waiting for us.

931
01:17:57,750 --> 01:18:00,662
It is a great gift
to see you alive, Your Majesty.

932
01:18:00,790 --> 01:18:03,623
With the communications breakdown,
we've been very concerned.

933
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:06,105
I'm anxious to hear your report
on the situation.

934
01:18:06,230 --> 01:18:08,744
May I present
Supreme Chancellor Valorum.

935
01:18:08,870 --> 01:18:10,747
Welcome, Your Highness.

936
01:18:10,870 --> 01:18:12,826
It's an honour to finally
meet you in person.

937
01:18:12,950 --> 01:18:14,349
Thank you, Supreme Chancellor.

938
01:18:14,470 --> 01:18:17,826
I must relay to you how distressed
everyone is over the current situation.

939
01:18:17,950 --> 01:18:21,226
I've called for a special session
of the senate to hear your position.

940
01:18:22,350 --> 01:18:25,308
I'm grateful for your concern,
Chancellor.

941
01:18:25,430 --> 01:18:27,227
There is a question
of procedure...

942
01:18:27,350 --> 01:18:29,739
but I'm confident
we can overcome it.

943
01:18:30,550 --> 01:18:32,620
I must speak with the Jedi Council
immediately.

944
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:35,423
The situation has become
much more complicated.

945
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:42,781
Ani, come on.

946
01:18:53,550 --> 01:18:56,144
Da queen's a bein grossly nice,
mesa tinks.

947
01:18:57,430 --> 01:18:59,307
Pitty hot.

948
01:19:26,070 --> 01:19:29,062
There is no civility,
only politics.

949
01:19:30,310 --> 01:19:34,019
The Republic
is not what it once was.

950
01:19:34,150 --> 01:19:39,178
The senate is full of greedy,
squabbling delegates.

951
01:19:39,950 --> 01:19:43,226
There is no interest
in the common good.

952
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:45,628
I must be frank, Your Majesty.

953
01:19:45,750 --> 01:19:48,344
There is little chance the senate
will act on the invasion.

954
01:19:48,470 --> 01:19:51,064
Chancellor Valorum
seems to think there is hope.

955
01:19:51,190 --> 01:19:52,987
If I may say so, Your Majesty...

956
01:19:53,110 --> 01:19:55,226
the chancellor
has little real power.

957
01:19:55,350 --> 01:19:59,059
He is mired by baseless
accusations of corruption.

958
01:19:59,190 --> 01:20:02,785
- The bureaucrats are in charge now.
- What options have we?

959
01:20:03,510 --> 01:20:06,263
Our best choice would be
to push for the election...

960
01:20:06,390 --> 01:20:08,506
of a stronger
supreme chancellor...

961
01:20:08,630 --> 01:20:10,700
one who could control
the bureaucrats...

962
01:20:10,830 --> 01:20:12,582
and give us justice.

963
01:20:13,430 --> 01:20:18,709
You could call for a vote of
no confidence in Chancellor Valorum.

964
01:20:18,830 --> 01:20:21,219
He has been
our strongest supporter.

965
01:20:21,350 --> 01:20:26,344
Our only other choice would be
to submit a plea to the courts.

966
01:20:26,470 --> 01:20:29,667
The courts take even longer
to decide things than the senate.

967
01:20:30,550 --> 01:20:32,541
Our people are dying, Senator.

968
01:20:33,310 --> 01:20:36,188
We must do something quickly
to stop the Federation.

969
01:20:36,310 --> 01:20:38,699
To be realistic, Your Majesty...

970
01:20:38,830 --> 01:20:41,219
I think we're going to have to
accept Federation control...

971
01:20:41,350 --> 01:20:43,739
for the time being.

972
01:20:45,430 --> 01:20:47,421
That is something I cannot do.

973
01:20:54,470 --> 01:20:56,938
He was trained in the Jedi arts.

974
01:20:57,070 --> 01:21:00,824
My only conclusion can be
that it was a Sith lord.

975
01:21:00,950 --> 01:21:02,269
Impossible.

976
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:04,950
The Sith have been extinct
for a millennium.

977
01:21:05,070 --> 01:21:09,063
I do not believe the Sith could
have returned without us knowing.

978
01:21:10,030 --> 01:21:12,146
Hard to see,
the dark side is.

979
01:21:12,270 --> 01:21:15,023
We will use all our resources
to unravel this mystery.

980
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:18,222
We will discover the identity
of your attacker.

981
01:21:18,350 --> 01:21:19,942
May the Force be with you.

982
01:21:23,830 --> 01:21:25,229
Master Qui-Gon.

983
01:21:26,070 --> 01:21:27,788
More to say have you?

984
01:21:29,830 --> 01:21:31,627
With your permission, my master...

985
01:21:33,110 --> 01:21:35,988
I have encountered
a vergence in the Force.

986
01:21:37,070 --> 01:21:38,981
A vergence, you say.

987
01:21:39,110 --> 01:21:41,146
Located around a person?

988
01:21:41,270 --> 01:21:42,464
A boy.

989
01:21:42,590 --> 01:21:44,979
His cells have the highest
concentration of midi-chlorians...

990
01:21:45,110 --> 01:21:46,828
I have seen in a life-form.

991
01:21:46,950 --> 01:21:49,703
It is possible he was conceived
by the midi-chlorians.

992
01:21:51,350 --> 01:21:55,059
You refer to the prophecy of the one
who will bring balance to the Force.

993
01:21:55,830 --> 01:21:57,866
You believe it's this boy?

994
01:21:57,990 --> 01:22:00,458
- I don't presume to-
- But you do.

995
01:22:01,190 --> 01:22:03,067
Revealed your opinion is.

996
01:22:03,190 --> 01:22:05,146
I request the boy be tested,
Master.

997
01:22:07,190 --> 01:22:10,262
<i>Trained as a Jedi
you request for him, hmm?</i>

998
01:22:10,390 --> 01:22:12,665
Finding him
was the will of the Force.

999
01:22:12,790 --> 01:22:14,940
I have no doubt of that.

1000
01:22:21,350 --> 01:22:23,306
Bring him before us, then.

1001
01:22:33,950 --> 01:22:35,747
The boy's here to see PadmÈ.

1002
01:22:35,870 --> 01:22:37,383
<i>Let him in.</i>

1003
01:22:40,470 --> 01:22:44,179
I'm sorry, Ani, but PadmÈ's
not here right now.

1004
01:22:44,310 --> 01:22:45,902
Who is it?

1005
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:49,548
Anakin Skywalker to see PadmÈ,
Your Highness.

1006
01:22:49,670 --> 01:22:51,388
I've sent PadmÈ on an errand.

1007
01:22:51,510 --> 01:22:53,307
I'm on my way
to the Jedi temple...

1008
01:22:53,430 --> 01:22:55,580
to start my training, I hope.

1009
01:22:56,390 --> 01:23:00,065
I may never see her again,
so I came to say goodbye.

1010
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:04,580
We will tell her for you.
We are sure her heart goes with you.

1011
01:23:05,670 --> 01:23:06,659
Thank you, Your Highness.

1012
01:23:20,110 --> 01:23:24,023
The chair recognizes the senator
from the sovereign system of Naboo.

1013
01:23:30,550 --> 01:23:33,781
Supreme Chancellor,
delegates of the senate...

1014
01:23:34,870 --> 01:23:37,145
a tragedy has occurred...

1015
01:23:37,270 --> 01:23:40,626
which started right here
with the taxation of trade routes...

1016
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:43,628
and has now engulfed
our entire planet...

1017
01:23:43,750 --> 01:23:45,661
in the oppression
of the Trade Federation.

1018
01:23:46,510 --> 01:23:47,863
This is outrageous!

1019
01:23:47,990 --> 01:23:50,424
I object
to the senator's statements.

1020
01:23:50,550 --> 01:23:54,429
The chair does not recognize the senator
from the Trade Federation at this time.

1021
01:23:54,550 --> 01:23:58,259
To state our allegations,
I present Queen Amidala...

1022
01:23:58,390 --> 01:24:00,301
recently elected
ruler of the Naboo...

1023
01:24:00,430 --> 01:24:02,227
who speaks on our behalf.

1024
01:24:07,990 --> 01:24:10,629
Honourable representatives
of the Republic...

1025
01:24:11,350 --> 01:24:13,705
I come to you under the gravest
of circumstances.

1026
01:24:13,830 --> 01:24:16,583
The Naboo system has been invaded
by the droid armies of the Trade-

1027
01:24:16,710 --> 01:24:20,100
I object!
There is no proof!

1028
01:24:20,230 --> 01:24:22,027
This is incredible.

1029
01:24:22,150 --> 01:24:25,938
We recommend a commission be sent
to Naboo to ascertain the truth.

1030
01:24:26,070 --> 01:24:27,298
The Congress of Malastare...

1031
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:30,308
concurs with the honourable delegate
from the Trade Federation.

1032
01:24:30,430 --> 01:24:32,386
A commission must be appointed.

1033
01:24:32,510 --> 01:24:34,899
- The point-
- Excuse me, Chancellor.

1034
01:24:35,030 --> 01:24:36,588
Enter the bureaucrat.

1035
01:24:36,710 --> 01:24:39,224
The true rulers of the Republic.

1036
01:24:39,350 --> 01:24:43,343
And on the payroll
of the Trade Federation, I might add.

1037
01:24:43,470 --> 01:24:47,509
This is where Chancellor Valorum's
strength will disappear.

1038
01:24:49,030 --> 01:24:51,225
The point is conceded.

1039
01:24:51,350 --> 01:24:53,864
Will you defer your motion
to allow a commission...

1040
01:24:53,990 --> 01:24:56,663
to explore the validity
of your accusations?

1041
01:24:56,790 --> 01:24:58,587
I will not defer.

1042
01:24:58,710 --> 01:25:02,066
I've come before you to resolve
this attack on our sovereignty now.

1043
01:25:02,190 --> 01:25:05,068
I was not elected to watch
my people suffer and die...

1044
01:25:05,190 --> 01:25:07,750
while you discuss this invasion
in a committee.

1045
01:25:10,590 --> 01:25:12,820
If this body
is not capable of action...

1046
01:25:12,950 --> 01:25:14,906
I suggest new leadership is needed.

1047
01:25:18,190 --> 01:25:20,306
I move for a vote
of no confidence...

1048
01:25:20,430 --> 01:25:22,341
in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.

1049
01:25:29,110 --> 01:25:31,180
Vote now! Vote now!

1050
01:25:34,830 --> 01:25:36,661
Order!

1051
01:25:36,790 --> 01:25:39,543
Now they will elect
a new chancellor...

1052
01:25:39,670 --> 01:25:41,467
a strong chancellor...

1053
01:25:41,590 --> 01:25:44,388
one who will not
let our tragedy continue.

1054
01:25:46,030 --> 01:25:50,103
The boy will not pass the council's
test, Master. He's too old.

1055
01:25:50,230 --> 01:25:53,222
Anakin will become a Jedi,
I promise you.

1056
01:25:53,350 --> 01:25:55,944
Do not defy the council,
Master, not again.

1057
01:25:56,070 --> 01:25:58,664
I shall do what I must, Obi-Wan.

1058
01:26:00,510 --> 01:26:04,105
<i>If you would just follow the code,
you would be on the council.</i>

1059
01:26:04,230 --> 01:26:06,186
They will not go along
with you this time.

1060
01:26:07,630 --> 01:26:10,098
You still have much to learn,
my young apprentice.

1061
01:26:13,270 --> 01:26:14,589
A ship.

1062
01:26:16,150 --> 01:26:18,027
A cup.

1063
01:26:18,150 --> 01:26:19,868
A ship.

1064
01:26:20,950 --> 01:26:22,349
A speeder.

1065
01:26:29,590 --> 01:26:31,421
How feel you?

1066
01:26:31,990 --> 01:26:33,582
Cold, sir.

1067
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:37,260
- Afraid are you?
- No, sir.

1068
01:26:38,390 --> 01:26:40,904
See through you we can.

1069
01:26:41,030 --> 01:26:42,827
Be mindful of your feelings.

1070
01:26:42,950 --> 01:26:45,589
Your thoughts dwell on your mother.

1071
01:26:47,190 --> 01:26:48,543
I miss her.

1072
01:26:49,750 --> 01:26:52,105
Afraid to lose her,
I think, mmm?

1073
01:26:52,230 --> 01:26:54,266
What has that got to do
with anything?

1074
01:26:54,390 --> 01:26:56,620
Everything.

1075
01:26:56,750 --> 01:26:59,662
Fear is the path to the dark side.

1076
01:26:59,790 --> 01:27:02,543
Fear leads to anger.
Anger leads to hate.

1077
01:27:02,670 --> 01:27:05,867
Hate leads to suffering.

1078
01:27:12,150 --> 01:27:14,948
I sense much fear in you.

1079
01:27:27,350 --> 01:27:30,581
<i>Yousa tinking
yousa people ganna die?</i>

1080
01:27:30,710 --> 01:27:31,984
I don't know.

1081
01:27:33,270 --> 01:27:35,067
Gungans get pasted too, eh?

1082
01:27:37,430 --> 01:27:39,386
I hope not.

1083
01:27:40,150 --> 01:27:42,266
Gungans no die'n without a fight.

1084
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:44,187
Wesa warriors.

1085
01:27:44,310 --> 01:27:47,427
Wesa got a grand army.

1086
01:27:47,550 --> 01:27:50,622
Dat's why you no liken us,
mesa tinks.

1087
01:27:50,750 --> 01:27:52,024
Your Highness?

1088
01:27:54,590 --> 01:27:56,626
Your Highness...

1089
01:27:56,750 --> 01:27:59,708
Senator Palpatine has been nominated
to succeed Valorum...

1090
01:27:59,830 --> 01:28:01,149
as supreme chancellor.

1091
01:28:01,270 --> 01:28:04,979
A surprise, to be sure,
but a welcome one.

1092
01:28:05,110 --> 01:28:09,308
Your Majesty, if I am elected,
I promise to put an end to corruption.

1093
01:28:09,430 --> 01:28:11,022
Who else has been nominated?

1094
01:28:11,150 --> 01:28:15,268
Bail Antilles of Alderaan
and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.

1095
01:28:15,390 --> 01:28:20,100
I feel confident our situation will
create a strong sympathy vote for us.

1096
01:28:21,750 --> 01:28:23,661
I will be chancellor.

1097
01:28:23,790 --> 01:28:26,258
I fear by the time you have control
of the bureaucrats, Senator...

1098
01:28:26,390 --> 01:28:29,462
there'll be nothing left
of our people, our way of life.

1099
01:28:29,590 --> 01:28:31,387
I understand your concern,
Your Majesty.

1100
01:28:31,510 --> 01:28:34,900
Unfortunately, the Federation
has possession of our planet.

1101
01:28:36,630 --> 01:28:40,259
Senator, this is your arena.

1102
01:28:40,630 --> 01:28:42,461
I feel I must return to mine.

1103
01:28:45,590 --> 01:28:47,785
I've decided to go back to Naboo.

1104
01:28:47,910 --> 01:28:48,740
Go back?

1105
01:28:48,870 --> 01:28:51,703
But, Your Majesty, be realistic.
They'll force you to sign the treaty.

1106
01:28:51,830 --> 01:28:54,105
I will sign no treaty, Senator.

1107
01:28:54,230 --> 01:28:56,903
My fate will be no different
than that of our people.

1108
01:28:57,030 --> 01:28:58,543
- Captain.
- Your Highness.

1109
01:28:58,670 --> 01:29:00,865
- Ready my ship.
- Please, Your Majesty.

1110
01:29:00,990 --> 01:29:02,787
Stay here where it's safe.

1111
01:29:04,230 --> 01:29:07,267
It is clear to me now that
the Republic no longer functions.

1112
01:29:07,990 --> 01:29:11,949
I pray you will bring sanity
and compassion back to the senate.

1113
01:29:21,270 --> 01:29:23,738
The Force is strong with him.

1114
01:29:23,870 --> 01:29:25,701
He is to be trained, then?

1115
01:29:27,750 --> 01:29:30,025
No, he will not be trained.

1116
01:29:30,150 --> 01:29:31,742
No?

1117
01:29:33,710 --> 01:29:35,666
He is too old.

1118
01:29:35,790 --> 01:29:39,419
He is the chosen one.
You must see it.

1119
01:29:40,550 --> 01:29:43,940
Clouded this boy's future is.

1120
01:29:46,070 --> 01:29:47,822
I will train him, then.

1121
01:29:51,990 --> 01:29:54,709
I take Anakin
as my Padawan learner.

1122
01:29:54,830 --> 01:29:57,628
An apprentice you have, Qui-Gon.

1123
01:29:57,750 --> 01:30:00,025
Impossible to take on a second.

1124
01:30:00,150 --> 01:30:01,742
The code forbids it.

1125
01:30:01,870 --> 01:30:05,101
- Obi-Wan is ready.
- I am ready to face the trials.

1126
01:30:05,230 --> 01:30:08,700
Our own counsel we will keep
on who is ready.

1127
01:30:09,670 --> 01:30:12,184
He is headstrong and he has much
to learn of the living Force...

1128
01:30:12,310 --> 01:30:13,948
but he is capable.

1129
01:30:14,070 --> 01:30:15,981
There is little more
he can learn from me.

1130
01:30:18,470 --> 01:30:22,099
Young Skywalker's fate
will be decided later.

1131
01:30:22,230 --> 01:30:24,698
Now is not the time for this.

1132
01:30:25,470 --> 01:30:27,347
The senate is voting
for a new supreme chancellor...

1133
01:30:27,470 --> 01:30:30,030
and Queen Amidala
is returning home...

1134
01:30:30,150 --> 01:30:33,222
which puts pressure on the Federation
and could widen the confrontation.

1135
01:30:33,350 --> 01:30:35,545
And draw out the queen's attacker.

1136
01:30:35,670 --> 01:30:39,868
Go with the queen to Naboo and discover
the identity of this dark warrior.

1137
01:30:41,110 --> 01:30:42,589
This is the clue we need...

1138
01:30:42,710 --> 01:30:45,178
to unravel
the mystery of the Sith.

1139
01:30:45,870 --> 01:30:47,986
May the Force be with you.

1140
01:31:00,630 --> 01:31:03,383
It's not disrespect, Master.
It's the truth.

1141
01:31:03,510 --> 01:31:05,307
From your point of view.

1142
01:31:05,430 --> 01:31:08,661
The boy is dangerous.
They all sense it. Why can't you?

1143
01:31:08,790 --> 01:31:11,543
His fate is uncertain.
He's not dangerous.

1144
01:31:11,670 --> 01:31:13,945
The council will decide
Anakin's future.

1145
01:31:14,070 --> 01:31:16,868
That should be enough for you.
Now get on board.

1146
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:25,905
Qui-Gon, sir,
I don't want to be a problem.

1147
01:31:26,030 --> 01:31:28,146
You won't be, Ani.

1148
01:31:28,270 --> 01:31:30,101
I'm not allowed to train you...

1149
01:31:30,230 --> 01:31:32,186
so I want you to watch me
and be mindful.

1150
01:31:32,310 --> 01:31:34,301
Always remember:

1151
01:31:35,190 --> 01:31:37,704
Your focus determines your reality.

1152
01:31:37,830 --> 01:31:41,266
Stay close to me
and you'll be safe.

1153
01:31:41,390 --> 01:31:42,709
Master, sir...

1154
01:31:42,830 --> 01:31:46,266
I heard Yoda talking
about midi-chlorians.

1155
01:31:46,390 --> 01:31:49,746
I've been wondering-
What are midi-chlorians?

1156
01:31:50,990 --> 01:31:53,265
Midi-chlorians are
a microscopic life-form...

1157
01:31:53,390 --> 01:31:55,540
that resides
within all living cells.

1158
01:31:56,950 --> 01:31:59,703
- They live inside me?
- Inside your cells, yes.

1159
01:31:59,830 --> 01:32:03,140
- And we are symbionts with them.
- Symbionts?

1160
01:32:03,270 --> 01:32:06,979
Life-forms living together
for mutual advantage.

1161
01:32:07,110 --> 01:32:09,863
Without the midi-chlorians,
life could not exist...

1162
01:32:09,990 --> 01:32:12,663
and we would have
no knowledge of the Force.

1163
01:32:12,790 --> 01:32:14,587
They continually speak to us...

1164
01:32:14,710 --> 01:32:17,270
telling us the will of the Force.

1165
01:32:17,390 --> 01:32:19,381
When you learn
to quiet your mind...

1166
01:32:19,510 --> 01:32:21,307
<i>you'll hear them speaking to you.</i>

1167
01:32:21,430 --> 01:32:23,227
I don't understand.

1168
01:32:23,350 --> 01:32:26,706
<i>With time and training, Ani,
you will. You will.</i>

1169
01:32:30,590 --> 01:32:34,185
Your Majesty, it is our pleasure
to continue to serve and protect you.

1170
01:32:34,870 --> 01:32:36,223
I welcome your help.

1171
01:32:36,350 --> 01:32:39,899
Senator Palpatine fears that
the Federation means to destroy me.

1172
01:32:40,030 --> 01:32:42,908
I assure you I will not
allow that to happen.

1173
01:32:43,030 --> 01:32:45,783
Wesa goin' home!

1174
01:32:45,910 --> 01:32:47,707
Come on, R2.

1175
01:32:57,550 --> 01:32:59,825
<i>Is the planet secure?</i>

1176
01:32:59,950 --> 01:33:03,659
We have taken over the last pockets
of primitive life-forms.

1177
01:33:03,790 --> 01:33:06,748
We are in complete control
of the planet now.

1178
01:33:06,870 --> 01:33:09,907
<i>Good. I will see to it
that in the senate...</i>

1179
01:33:10,030 --> 01:33:12,828
<i>things stay as they are.</i>

1180
01:33:12,950 --> 01:33:16,306
<i>I am sending my apprentice,
Darth Maul, to join you.</i>

1181
01:33:16,430 --> 01:33:18,227
Yes, my lord.

1182
01:33:18,350 --> 01:33:20,147
A Sith here?

1183
01:33:25,350 --> 01:33:27,705
Those are the forward stabilizers.

1184
01:33:27,830 --> 01:33:30,105
And those two control the pitch?

1185
01:33:31,630 --> 01:33:33,427
You catch on pretty quick.

1186
01:33:33,550 --> 01:33:35,222
As soon as we land...

1187
01:33:35,350 --> 01:33:37,864
the Federation will arrest you
and force you to sign the treaty.

1188
01:33:37,990 --> 01:33:38,979
I agree.

1189
01:33:39,110 --> 01:33:41,749
I'm not sure what you wish
to accomplish by this.

1190
01:33:41,870 --> 01:33:44,225
I will take back what's ours.

1191
01:33:44,990 --> 01:33:47,060
There are too few of us,
Your Highness.

1192
01:33:47,190 --> 01:33:48,987
We have no army.

1193
01:33:49,110 --> 01:33:50,429
And I can only protect you.

1194
01:33:50,550 --> 01:33:52,506
I can't fight a war for you.

1195
01:33:53,510 --> 01:33:54,499
Jar Jar Binks.

1196
01:33:55,390 --> 01:33:57,460
Mesa, Your Highness?

1197
01:33:57,590 --> 01:34:00,388
Yes. I need your help.

1198
01:34:05,430 --> 01:34:07,546
I have one battleship on my scope.

1199
01:34:07,670 --> 01:34:09,626
It's a droid control ship.

1200
01:34:09,750 --> 01:34:11,866
They've probably spotted us.

1201
01:34:11,990 --> 01:34:13,628
We haven't much time.

1202
01:34:24,870 --> 01:34:27,430
Jar Jar is on his way
to the Gungan city, Master.

1203
01:34:27,550 --> 01:34:28,778
Good.

1204
01:34:28,910 --> 01:34:31,060
Do you think
the queen's idea will work?

1205
01:34:31,190 --> 01:34:32,748
The Gungans will not
be easily swayed.

1206
01:34:34,750 --> 01:34:36,980
And we cannot use our power
to help her.

1207
01:34:38,710 --> 01:34:41,668
I'm sorry for
my behaviour, Master.

1208
01:34:41,790 --> 01:34:45,339
It's not my place to disagree
with you about the boy.

1209
01:34:47,190 --> 01:34:50,341
And I am grateful you think
I'm ready to take the trials.

1210
01:34:51,470 --> 01:34:53,267
You've been a good apprentice,
Obi-Wan.

1211
01:34:54,670 --> 01:34:57,230
And you're a much wiser man
than I am.

1212
01:34:57,910 --> 01:35:01,107
I foresee you will become
a great Jedi knight.

1213
01:35:13,590 --> 01:35:15,865
Desa nobody dare!

1214
01:35:15,990 --> 01:35:18,060
The Gungan city is deserted!

1215
01:35:18,190 --> 01:35:20,624
Some kinda fight, mesa tinks.

1216
01:35:20,750 --> 01:35:23,708
Do you think they have been taken
to the camps?

1217
01:35:23,830 --> 01:35:26,060
More likely they were wiped out.

1218
01:35:26,190 --> 01:35:29,102
- Mesa no tink so.
- Do you know where they are,Jar Jar?

1219
01:35:29,230 --> 01:35:32,506
When in trouble,
Gungans go to sacred place.

1220
01:35:32,630 --> 01:35:35,383
Mesa show you.
Come on. Mesa show you!

1221
01:35:52,990 --> 01:35:56,426
Your Honour,
Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1222
01:36:02,830 --> 01:36:06,027
Heyo dadee
Big Boss Nass, Your Honour.

1223
01:36:06,790 --> 01:36:09,099
Jar Jar Binks.

1224
01:36:09,590 --> 01:36:12,707
Who's da uss-en uthers?

1225
01:36:13,270 --> 01:36:15,465
I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

1226
01:36:16,270 --> 01:36:18,579
I come before you in peace.

1227
01:36:18,710 --> 01:36:21,429
Ah, Naboo biggen.

1228
01:36:21,550 --> 01:36:24,587
Yousa bringen da Mackineeks.

1229
01:36:24,710 --> 01:36:28,259
Yousa all bombad.

1230
01:36:29,110 --> 01:36:31,829
We have searched you out
because we wish to form an alliance.

1231
01:36:31,950 --> 01:36:33,269
Your Honour.

1232
01:36:35,350 --> 01:36:38,183
Whosa dis?

1233
01:36:38,310 --> 01:36:40,426
I am Queen Amidala.

1234
01:36:42,030 --> 01:36:43,543
This is my decoy...

1235
01:36:43,670 --> 01:36:47,140
my protection,
my loyal bodyguard.

1236
01:36:47,270 --> 01:36:51,388
I'm sorry for my deception,
but it was necessary to protect myself.

1237
01:36:51,510 --> 01:36:53,944
Although we do not always agree,
Your Honour...

1238
01:36:54,070 --> 01:36:56,504
our two great societies
have always lived in peace.

1239
01:36:58,230 --> 01:37:01,267
The Trade Federation has destroyed all
that we have worked so hard to build.

1240
01:37:01,390 --> 01:37:04,507
If we do not act quickly,
all will be lost forever.

1241
01:37:04,630 --> 01:37:06,746
I ask you to help us.

1242
01:37:06,870 --> 01:37:09,464
No, I beg you to help us.

1243
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:11,865
We are your humble servants.

1244
01:37:14,990 --> 01:37:17,663
Our fate is in your hands.

1245
01:37:34,190 --> 01:37:38,263
Yousa no tinken yousa
greater den da Gungans?

1246
01:37:40,630 --> 01:37:44,384
Mesa lika dis!

1247
01:37:45,390 --> 01:37:46,220
Maybe...

1248
01:37:46,350 --> 01:37:48,784
wesa...

1249
01:37:48,910 --> 01:37:50,707
being friends.

1250
01:37:59,070 --> 01:38:00,788
We've sent our patrols.

1251
01:38:00,910 --> 01:38:04,220
We already located
their starship in the swamp.

1252
01:38:04,350 --> 01:38:06,420
It won't be long, my lord.

1253
01:38:06,550 --> 01:38:09,542
<i>This is
an unexpected move for her.</i>

1254
01:38:09,670 --> 01:38:11,581
<i>It's too aggressive.</i>

1255
01:38:11,710 --> 01:38:14,019
<i>Lord Maul, be mindful.</i>

1256
01:38:14,150 --> 01:38:16,584
<i>Let them make the first move.</i>

1257
01:38:16,710 --> 01:38:18,507
Yes, my master.

1258
01:38:21,910 --> 01:38:23,502
Deysa comin!

1259
01:38:23,630 --> 01:38:24,904
All right!

1260
01:38:28,350 --> 01:38:29,988
They're here!

1261
01:38:30,110 --> 01:38:31,429
Good. They made it.

1262
01:38:35,830 --> 01:38:38,390
Yousa doen grand.

1263
01:38:38,510 --> 01:38:41,468
Jar Jar bring uss-en
and da Naboo together.

1264
01:38:41,590 --> 01:38:43,387
Oh, no, no, no.

1265
01:38:43,510 --> 01:38:46,343
So, wesa make you...

1266
01:38:46,470 --> 01:38:48,859
bombad general.

1267
01:38:48,990 --> 01:38:50,343
General?

1268
01:38:53,310 --> 01:38:54,709
Captain.

1269
01:38:54,830 --> 01:38:57,298
- Your Highness.
- What is the situation?

1270
01:38:57,430 --> 01:38:59,227
Almost everyone's in camps.

1271
01:38:59,350 --> 01:39:02,422
A few hundred police and guards formed
an underground resistance movement.

1272
01:39:02,550 --> 01:39:04,984
I brought back as many
of the leaders as I could.

1273
01:39:05,110 --> 01:39:07,863
The Federation army's also
much larger than we thought...

1274
01:39:07,990 --> 01:39:09,582
and much stronger.

1275
01:39:10,830 --> 01:39:13,788
Your Highness, this is a battle
I do not think that we can win.

1276
01:39:13,910 --> 01:39:16,026
The battle is a diversion.

1277
01:39:16,150 --> 01:39:18,903
The Gungans must draw the droid army
away from the cities.

1278
01:39:19,030 --> 01:39:20,509
R2.

1279
01:39:21,590 --> 01:39:24,900
We can enter the city using the secret
passages on the waterfall side.

1280
01:39:25,030 --> 01:39:26,668
Once we get
to the main entrance...

1281
01:39:26,790 --> 01:39:29,748
Captain Panaka
will create a diversion.

1282
01:39:29,870 --> 01:39:32,668
Then we can enter the palace
and capture the viceroy.

1283
01:39:33,390 --> 01:39:36,063
Without the viceroy,
they will be lost and confused.

1284
01:39:36,190 --> 01:39:37,782
What do you think, Master Jedi?

1285
01:39:37,910 --> 01:39:39,980
The viceroy will be well-guarded.

1286
01:39:40,110 --> 01:39:42,499
The difficulty is getting
into the throne room.

1287
01:39:42,630 --> 01:39:44,825
Once we're inside,
we shouldn't have a problem.

1288
01:39:44,950 --> 01:39:49,466
There is a possibility, with this
diversion, many Gungans will be killed.

1289
01:39:49,590 --> 01:39:52,741
Wesa ready to do our-san part.

1290
01:39:52,870 --> 01:39:55,862
We have a plan which should
immobilize the droid army.

1291
01:39:55,990 --> 01:39:57,787
We will send
what pilots we have...

1292
01:39:57,910 --> 01:40:00,822
to knock out the droid control ship
orbiting the planet.

1293
01:40:00,950 --> 01:40:03,862
A well-conceived plan.
However, there's great risk.

1294
01:40:03,990 --> 01:40:06,982
The weapons on your fighters
may not penetrate the shields.

1295
01:40:07,110 --> 01:40:08,668
There's an even bigger danger.

1296
01:40:08,790 --> 01:40:10,587
If the viceroy escapes,
Your Highness...

1297
01:40:10,710 --> 01:40:12,826
he will return
with another droid army.

1298
01:40:12,950 --> 01:40:16,022
Well, that is why we must not fail
to get the viceroy.

1299
01:40:16,150 --> 01:40:17,981
Everything depends on it.

1300
01:40:23,110 --> 01:40:25,624
<i>She is more foolish
than I thought.</i>

1301
01:40:25,750 --> 01:40:27,627
We are sending all troops...

1302
01:40:27,750 --> 01:40:30,503
to meet this army
assembling near the swamp.

1303
01:40:30,630 --> 01:40:33,144
It appears to be made up
of primitives.

1304
01:40:33,270 --> 01:40:35,704
<i>This will work to our advantage.</i>

1305
01:40:35,830 --> 01:40:38,503
I have your approval
to proceed, then, my lord?

1306
01:40:39,270 --> 01:40:40,908
<i>Wipe them out.</i>

1307
01:40:42,550 --> 01:40:44,347
<i>All of them.</i>

1308
01:41:13,990 --> 01:41:15,309
Halt!

1309
01:41:18,630 --> 01:41:20,780
Starting up the shield.

1310
01:41:49,110 --> 01:41:50,259
Open fire.

1311
01:42:05,710 --> 01:42:08,782
Once we get inside, you find
a safe place to hide and stay there.

1312
01:42:08,910 --> 01:42:10,741
- Sure.
- Stay there.

1313
01:42:26,070 --> 01:42:28,026
Roger, roger.

1314
01:42:35,750 --> 01:42:38,742
I thought the battle was going
to take place far from here.

1315
01:42:39,790 --> 01:42:41,223
This is too close.

1316
01:42:46,950 --> 01:42:49,225
Ani, find cover.

1317
01:42:49,350 --> 01:42:51,545
- Quick!
- Get to your ships!

1318
01:43:47,910 --> 01:43:48,979
Fighters straight ahead.

1319
01:43:49,110 --> 01:43:50,179
Roger, Bravo Leader.

1320
01:43:50,310 --> 01:43:51,459
Roger, Bravo Leader.

1321
01:43:59,790 --> 01:44:00,825
Cease fire.

1322
01:44:08,070 --> 01:44:10,379
Steady. Steady.

1323
01:44:42,150 --> 01:44:45,222
- Activate the droids.
- Yes, sir.

1324
01:45:01,070 --> 01:45:02,901
Ouch time.

1325
01:45:16,430 --> 01:45:17,465
Fire!

1326
01:45:38,830 --> 01:45:40,582
My guess is the viceroy's
in the throne room.

1327
01:45:40,710 --> 01:45:42,109
Red group! Blue group!

1328
01:45:42,230 --> 01:45:43,948
Everybody, this way!

1329
01:45:44,070 --> 01:45:46,026
Hey, wait for me!

1330
01:45:46,150 --> 01:45:48,425
Anakin, stay where you are.
You'll be safe there.

1331
01:45:48,550 --> 01:45:50,461
- But I-
- Stay in that cockpit.

1332
01:46:02,150 --> 01:46:05,222
- We'll handle this.
- We'll take the long way.

1333
01:46:24,590 --> 01:46:26,421
We gotta do something, R2.

1334
01:46:48,310 --> 01:46:51,188
I'm trying to!
I don't know where the trigger is!

1335
01:46:54,510 --> 01:46:57,422
Oops, wrong one.
Maybe it's this one.

1336
01:46:58,390 --> 01:47:00,741
Nope. Wait. Here it is.

1337
01:47:02,870 --> 01:47:03,780
Yeah!

1338
01:47:08,950 --> 01:47:10,383
Let's go!

1339
01:47:11,430 --> 01:47:13,580
It's on automatic pilot.

1340
01:47:22,310 --> 01:47:24,107
Try to override it.

1341
01:48:21,710 --> 01:48:23,541
We don't have time for this,
Captain.

1342
01:48:29,430 --> 01:48:31,182
Look, there they are.

1343
01:48:31,310 --> 01:48:33,585
That's where
the autopilot's taking us.

1344
01:48:49,910 --> 01:48:52,424
Dumb droid. Take that!

1345
01:48:52,550 --> 01:48:54,381
Get off! Get off! Get off!

1346
01:48:54,510 --> 01:48:55,625
Get off!

1347
01:49:05,270 --> 01:49:07,545
The deflector shield
is too strong.

1348
01:49:16,470 --> 01:49:18,062
This is tense!

1349
01:49:20,270 --> 01:49:22,181
R2, get us off this autopilot.

1350
01:49:22,310 --> 01:49:24,107
It's gonna get us both killed.

1351
01:49:25,710 --> 01:49:28,019
You did it, R2!

1352
01:49:28,150 --> 01:49:29,299
Let's go left.

1353
01:49:34,310 --> 01:49:35,379
Go back?

1354
01:49:35,510 --> 01:49:39,628
Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit,
so that's what I'm gonna do.

1355
01:49:46,230 --> 01:49:48,585
I'll try spinning.
That's a good trick.

1356
01:49:54,030 --> 01:49:56,464
I know we're in trouble.
Just hang on.

1357
01:50:03,030 --> 01:50:03,985
Go!

1358
01:50:08,630 --> 01:50:10,268
Ascension guns!

1359
01:52:11,270 --> 01:52:12,828
Retreat! Retreat!

1360
01:52:14,510 --> 01:52:16,341
Dis is nutsen.

1361
01:52:25,830 --> 01:52:27,707
Uh-oh. Big boomers.

1362
01:52:47,590 --> 01:52:49,899
Give me a lift!

1363
01:52:56,870 --> 01:52:58,383
Jar Jar, usen da booma!

1364
01:52:58,510 --> 01:53:00,341
What?
Mesa no have a booma!

1365
01:53:00,470 --> 01:53:02,347
Here. Taken dis one.

1366
01:53:18,110 --> 01:53:19,145
Jar Jar!

1367
01:53:19,270 --> 01:53:21,147
Jump,Jar Jar, jump!

1368
01:53:30,910 --> 01:53:33,583
Put down your weapons.
They win this round.

1369
01:53:45,990 --> 01:53:48,026
We're hit, R2!

1370
01:54:00,710 --> 01:54:03,543
I'm trying to stop!
I'm trying to stop!

1371
01:54:10,470 --> 01:54:11,949
Everything's overheated.

1372
01:54:13,350 --> 01:54:15,227
Oops. This is not good.

1373
01:55:24,710 --> 01:55:26,826
No giben up, General Jar Jar.

1374
01:55:26,950 --> 01:55:28,747
Mesa think of something.

1375
01:55:28,870 --> 01:55:30,189
Hands up.

1376
01:55:30,310 --> 01:55:33,063
My give up. My give up.

1377
01:55:41,430 --> 01:55:44,422
Your little insurrection
is at an end, Your Highness.

1378
01:55:44,550 --> 01:55:46,347
Time for you
to sign the treaty and end...

1379
01:55:46,470 --> 01:55:48,267
this pointless debate in the senate.

1380
01:55:48,390 --> 01:55:50,062
Viceroy!

1381
01:55:50,190 --> 01:55:52,021
Your occupation here has ended.

1382
01:55:53,550 --> 01:55:56,781
After her.
This one's a decoy.

1383
01:56:03,110 --> 01:56:04,509
Captain!

1384
01:56:13,390 --> 01:56:15,346
Jam the doors.

1385
01:56:18,670 --> 01:56:21,423
Now, Viceroy,
we will discuss a new treaty.

1386
01:57:22,030 --> 01:57:24,419
Yes! We have power.
Shields up.

1387
01:57:27,590 --> 01:57:28,579
Take this!

1388
01:57:30,510 --> 01:57:31,545
And this!

1389
01:57:39,110 --> 01:57:40,782
- Oops.
- We're losing power.

1390
01:57:40,910 --> 01:57:42,662
There seems to be a problem
with the main reactor.

1391
01:57:42,790 --> 01:57:44,109
Impossible!

1392
01:57:44,230 --> 01:57:46,027
Nothing can get through our shield.

1393
01:57:47,270 --> 01:57:48,988
Let's get outta here.

1394
01:57:56,710 --> 01:57:59,224
What's that?
It's blowing up from the inside!

1395
01:58:02,150 --> 01:58:03,663
We didn't hit it.

1396
01:58:06,630 --> 01:58:08,586
Now, this is Podracing.

1397
01:58:10,150 --> 01:58:11,788
Look, one of ours,
out of the main hold!

1398
01:58:32,310 --> 01:58:33,709
What the-

1399
01:58:33,830 --> 01:58:35,946
Was'n they doing?

1400
01:58:36,070 --> 01:58:39,506
The control ship
has been destroyed. Look!

1401
01:58:41,150 --> 01:58:43,380
They all broke-ed.

1402
01:59:29,830 --> 01:59:33,061
No, it's too late.

1403
01:59:33,190 --> 01:59:35,385
- No.
- Obi-Wan.

1404
01:59:36,630 --> 01:59:38,427
Promise-

1405
01:59:38,550 --> 01:59:40,984
<i>Promise me
you will train the boy.</i>

1406
01:59:41,110 --> 01:59:42,589
Yes, Master.

1407
01:59:46,510 --> 01:59:48,978
He is the chosen one.

1408
01:59:49,110 --> 01:59:52,182
He will bring balance.

1409
01:59:53,350 --> 01:59:54,703
Train him.

1410
02:00:21,110 --> 02:00:22,828
Now, Viceroy...

1411
02:00:22,950 --> 02:00:26,226
<i>you're going to have to go back
to the senate and explain all this.</i>

1412
02:00:27,910 --> 02:00:31,061
<i>I think you can kiss
your trade franchise goodbye.</i>

1413
02:00:44,230 --> 02:00:47,620
We are indebted to you
for your bravery, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

1414
02:00:47,750 --> 02:00:49,547
And you, young Skywalker.

1415
02:00:50,310 --> 02:00:53,461
We will watch your career
with great interest.

1416
02:00:59,750 --> 02:01:02,184
Congratulations on your election,
Chancellor.

1417
02:01:02,310 --> 02:01:05,586
Your boldness has saved our people,
Your Majesty.

1418
02:01:05,710 --> 02:01:07,985
It's you who should be
congratulated.

1419
02:01:08,110 --> 02:01:11,864
Together we shall bring peace
and prosperity to the Republic.

1420
02:01:16,710 --> 02:01:20,942
Confer on you the level
of Jedi knight the council does.

1421
02:01:21,070 --> 02:01:25,586
But agree with your taking this boy
as your Padawan learner...

1422
02:01:25,710 --> 02:01:27,507
I do not.

1423
02:01:27,630 --> 02:01:29,621
Qui-Gon believed in him.

1424
02:01:32,430 --> 02:01:34,990
The chosen one the boy may be.

1425
02:01:35,110 --> 02:01:36,668
Nevertheless...

1426
02:01:36,790 --> 02:01:39,543
grave danger I fear
in his training.

1427
02:01:39,670 --> 02:01:43,629
Master Yoda,
I gave Qui-Gon my word.

1428
02:01:43,750 --> 02:01:45,581
I will train Anakin.

1429
02:01:47,750 --> 02:01:49,980
Without the approval
of the council, if I must.

1430
02:01:50,110 --> 02:01:52,465
Qui-Gon's defiance
I sense in you.

1431
02:01:52,590 --> 02:01:54,421
Need that you do not.

1432
02:01:56,590 --> 02:01:59,707
Agree with you the council does.

1433
02:02:00,790 --> 02:02:03,941
Your apprentice Skywalker will be.

1434
02:02:30,630 --> 02:02:32,302
What will happen to me now?

1435
02:02:32,430 --> 02:02:35,342
The council have granted me
permission to train you.

1436
02:02:35,470 --> 02:02:38,746
You will be a Jedi, I promise.

1437
02:02:47,790 --> 02:02:51,021
There's no doubt
the mysterious warrior was a Sith.

1438
02:02:51,150 --> 02:02:53,505
Always two there are.

1439
02:02:53,630 --> 02:02:56,702
No more, no less.

1440
02:02:56,830 --> 02:02:59,628
A master and an apprentice.

1441
02:02:59,750 --> 02:03:01,229
But which was destroyed?

1442
02:03:01,350 --> 02:03:04,183
The master or the apprentice?

1443
02:03:27,830 --> 02:03:29,786
Hidoe, everybody!

1444
02:04:14,510 --> 02:04:16,341
Peace!
